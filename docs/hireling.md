# Introduction

This guide is intended to provide structured rules for hiring mercenaries and other hirelings, among other rules relating to creatures and gold, beyond those present in the Player's Handbook.

Specifically, this guide contains rules for the following:
* Hiring mercenaries for combat
* Hiring mercenaries with tool proficiencies
* Designating appropriate bounties for creatures
* Additional statblocks for NPCs

## Hiring Hirelings

The Player's Handbook has very barebones rules for hiring NPCs. An unskilled hireling costs 2 sp per day, while a skilled hireling (one with proficiency in a marketable tool or skill) costs 2 gp per day. Messengers and transportation is priced by distance, not by time.

### Unskilled Laborers

The default cost for hiring a common laborer is 2 silver pieces per day. Though the economies of modern America and fantasy medieval Europe are quite different, 2 sp/day can be thought of as a sort of "minimum wage": enough to pay for basic living expenses and not much else. In DnD 5e, this is enough to live a Poor lifestyle.

However, in particularly impoverished neighborhoods, characters might be able to hire unskilled laborers for as little as 1 sp/day. Characters of good alignment should avoid doing so unless absolutely necessary, as such laborers can only live a Squalid lifestyle on such pay.

Likewise, in areas without a significant population of unemployed poor, unskilled work might come with a higher asking price. This price rarely exceeds 5 sp/day. In areas of exclusively skilled, wealthy people (such as a remote wizard's college), players might only have skilled laborers available for hire, and such labor might be exceedingly expensive or completely unavailable.

### Skilled Laborers

The default PHB rule for hiring a skilled worker is 2 gp/day. Obviously, this isn't a perfect solution. Hiring an apprentice blacksmith should be cheaper than hiring the most skilled Dwarven blacksmith in the world.

Of course, having a higher tool check modifier doesn't actually *do* anything in 5e by default. There's no rule that says you need to make a DC 18 Intelligence (smith's tools) check to craft plate armor. This guide assumes that you have your own houserules that make tool check modifiers actually matter, and assumes that NPCs with extreme skill can add double their proficiency bonus to tool checks.

\columnbreak

A skilled worker's price is determined by their modifier in their chosen trade. Certain trades might demand a higher price than others - an alchemist might cost more than a weaver, for instance - but the following formula works well for most NPCs. Which ability score is used for tool checks is largely up to the DM, so I'll largely leave that up to the DM as well; if you rule that most smith's tools checks are Intelligence-based, the price should be the NPC's Intelligence (smith's tools) modifier. If you say it should be Strength-based, it's Strength (smith's tools). A skilled laborer can use either a tool or a skill, depending on their profession.

Availability of skilled NPCs depends on the population of a settlement. Most villages only have basic craftspeople with a +2 modifier. The most skilled person in a town usually has a +6 to +8 modifier. Cities can have anywhere from a +12 to a +15. NPCs with modifiers higher than +15 are normally not available, and usually demand compensation beyond simple payment. They represent people of such skill that they are considered legendary.

<div style='column-count:2'>

 ##### Prices for Skilled Labor
 You might be wondering where I got the costs for skilled labor from. The formulas are mostly an effort to get certain classes of laborers into appropriate lifestyle expense categories. Your average blacksmith, for instance, is probably just a commoner with a +2 bonus on his checks, and should make the 2 gp/day suggested in the PHB. Likewise, a master craftsman with a +4 ability modifier, +4 proficiency bonus, and double proficiency on checks would have a +12 bonus, and should make about the same amount that a CR 12-13 mercenary would make (over 100 gp/day). An above-average blacksmith with double proficiency and a +2 modifier might have a +6 bonus on their checks, but shouldn't even be able to afford an aristocratic lifestyle (10 gp).

## Hiring Mercenaries

Sometimes the PCs might want to hire NPCs with combat experience to help them fight. This guide basically provides a formula to determine the cost in gold pieces per day to hire an NPC of a given CR.

Use the following table for NPCs of CR 0 to 1:

<div style='column-count:2'>

| CR  | Cost/Day |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  0  | 1 sp |
|  1/8  | 2 sp |
|  1/4  | 5 sp |
|  1/2  | 1 gp |
|  1  | 2 gp |

</div>

<div style='margin-top:10px;'></div>

For NPCs of CR 2 and higher, the price to hire that NPC is equal to their CR squared per day. The following table lists the results of this formula when applied to CRs 2 through 30, for ease of reference:

<div style='column-count:2'>

| d8  | Loot |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  2  | 4 gp |
|  3  | 9 gp |
|  4  | 16 gp |
|  5  | 25 gp |
|  6  | 36 gp |
|  7  | 49 gp |
|  8  | 64 gp |
|  9  | 81 gp |
|  10  | 100 gp |
|  11  | 121 gp |
|  12  | 144 gp |
|  13  | 169 gp |
|  14  | 196 gp |
|  15  | 225 gp |
|  16  | 256 gp |

| d8  | Loot |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  17  | 289 gp |
|  18  | 324 gp |
|  19  | 361 gp |
|  20  | 400 gp |
|  21  | 441 gp |
|  22  | 484 gp |
|  23  | 529 gp |
|  24  | 576 gp |
|  25  | 625 gp |
|  26  | 676 gp |
|  27  | 729 gp |
|  28  | 784 gp |
|  29  | 841 gp |
|  30  | 900 gp |

</div>

<div style='margin-top:20px;'></div>

<div class='descriptive'>
 
 ##### Price Too Low?
 These prices might seem low, but it's important to note that they are *per-day* costs, and some NPCs might demand to be hired for a minimum consecutive time period. Hiring a **warlord** doesn't cost them 144 gp; by default, they'd need to pay them a minimum of 1,728 gp for 12 days of work. If they want to take them into some highly perilous environment, such as a dungeon, that price might be 2,160 to 3,456 gp. Feel free to round up or down in order to make the costs for hiring NPCs seem a little less generated by a formula.
 
 </div>


\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:39px;'></div>

Of course, this table is not all-powerful. Not every NPC is available as a mercenary; just because the PCs offer someone the appropriate amount of gold doesn't mean they'll throw down their job and follow them into a dungeon. NPCs with a high opinion of themselves might require anywhere from 1.25 to 2 times or more the normal price, and some might just outright refuse.

### Minimum Terms of Service

Many more powerful NPCs require a minimum term of service. They value steady work over one-time gigs, and might charge as much as double their normal rate (or outright refuse to work for them) if the PCs are hiring them for less than this minimum term. Usually, this term is equal to the NPC's CR, though exceptional individuals might demand longer or shorter terms. While it might make sense in-character, this mechanic is intended to prevent the PCs from hiring exceptionally powerful individuals for one-day dungeon crawls and such.

### Modifiers for Dangerous Work

Not all work is equal. The base costs are intended for keeping the NPC on retainer for extended periods of time, with intermittent periods of fighting. An example would be in a war scenario where the PCs are fielding an army; most days, there's no fighting at all (though the threat of ambush is ever-present), and when fighting does happen it's not terribly lethal.

This sort of thing isn't true for dungeon-delving. Dungeons are extremely lethal, dangerous places where a mercenary might expect several times as much fighting as the worst day at war. NPCs might expect anywhere from 1.25 to 4 times as much pay for such a dangerous expedition, with the average being 2 times. Soldiers specialized in traditional warfare might outright refuse. This applies for all dangerous work; rumours of deadly battle-mages on the opposing side of a war might increase prices, since a single *fireball* can slay two dozen men in an instant. As the DM, use your discretion in modifying prices.

On the other hand, particularly safe work might require as little as .5 to .75 the normal cost. For example, if the PCs are just hiring guards for their stronghold, or the city watch of a town they preside over, these guards might expect little to no fighting over their careers. These kinds of mercenaries will, however, expect a bonus if fighting *does* break out.

### Monsters and Mages

At least in some settings, spellcasters can cost several times as much as a warrior of a comparable power level. If an NPC is a full spellcaster, you might decide to have them demand 2 to 8 times the usual price, depending on just how rare spellcasters are.

Monsters have wildly varying costs, depending on what kind of monster they are. Hill giants, goblinoids, ogres, and orcs are cheaper than other mercenaries for their CR; monsters with special powers, like medusas, mind flayers, and oni, would be more expensive.

## Bounties

Many authorities award the slaying of various monsters and other creatures. Sometimes these bounties are posted on a board in the town square, or fliers posted on the doors of taverns. This section details rules for what these bounties might be, very similar to those for hiring mercenaries in the previous page.

Use the following table for creatures of CR 0 to 1:

<div style='column-count:2'>

| CR  | Bounty |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  0  | 5 sp |
|  1/8  | 1 gp |
|  1/4  | 2 gp |
|  1/2  | 5 gp |
|  1  | 10 gp |

</div>

<div style='margin-top:10px;'></div>

For creatures of CR 2 and higher, the bounty for that creature is equal to their CR squared times 10. The following table lists the results of this formula when applied to CRs 2 through 30, for ease of reference:

<div style='column-count:2'>

| CR  | Bounty |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  2  | 40 gp |
|  3  | 90 gp |
|  4  | 160 gp |
|  5  | 250 gp |
|  6  | 360 gp |
|  7  | 490 gp |
|  8  | 640 gp |
|  9  | 810 gp |
|  10  | 1,000 gp |
|  11  | 1,210 gp |
|  12  | 1,440 gp |
|  13  | 1,690 gp |
|  14  | 1,960 gp |
|  15  | 2,250 gp |
|  16  | 2,560 gp |

| CR  | Bounty |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  17  | 2,890 gp |
|  18  | 3,240 gp |
|  19  | 3,610 gp |
|  20  | 4,000 gp |
|  21  | 4,410 gp |
|  22  | 4,840 gp |
|  23  | 5,290 gp |
|  24  | 5,760 gp |
|  25  | 6,250 gp |
|  26  | 6,760 gp |
|  27  | 7,290 gp |
|  28  | 7,840 gp |
|  29  | 8,410 gp |
|  30  | 9,000 gp |

</div>

<div style='margin-top:12px;'></div>

| Check Result | Price Modifier |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  <0   | × .25   |
|  0-4   | × .5   |
|  5-9   | × .75  |
|  10-14  | × 1    |
|  15-19  | × 1.25 |
|  20-24  | × 1.5  |
|  25-29  | × 1.75 |
|  30+  | × 2    |

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:39px;'></div>

This table is intended to only be used for creatures that some authority wants dead. The PCs shouldn't be able to go out in the woods, kill some weasels, and bring them back to town and sell them for a few silver each. They should only be able to do that if the local town has been plagued by trash-feeding weasels and the mayor is paying to want them dead.

### Most Wanted

Particular species or individuals might draw especial ire from the authority which is posting bounties. In these cases, the authority might pay anywhere from 1.25 to 1.5 times the usual price for bounties on that creature. For example, an elven town might pay 2 gp for a pair of goblin ears but 3 gp for a pair of drow ears, because while the goblins are a nuisance they *really* hate drow. And they might pay 800 gp for the head of a drow priestess of lolth, but 960 gp for the head of the drow matron mother, even if they are otherwise statistically identical, because while they *really* hate drow priestesses, they *really really* hate their leader.

### Rarity Aside from CR

CR is not always the best indicator of how hard it is to catch a particular individual. This is especially true for sneaky characters. Weeding out a measly **spy** could be several times as difficult as slaying the **giant toad** haunting the local swamps, and catching a **pixie** is nearly impossible if it doesn't want to be caught.

If a creature is particularly difficult to kill or capture, set an appropriate CR. This is largely up to the DM, because, in-game, it represents how difficult the bounty-giver thinks the task to be. And just like the DM might set a bounty to high or too low, this can mostly be excused as the bounty-giver setting the bounty too high or too low.

## Negotiating

For both hiring hirelings and accepting bounties, the PCs might be able to haggle for higher or lower prices.

The table to the left is for haggling for a higher bounty, and the one to the right is for convincing an NPC to work for a lower price. For either table, the haggler should roll a Charisma check (skill proficiencies may apply, at DM discretion). You should add a creature's proficiency bonus to the DCs in the first column.

| Check Result | Price Modifier |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  <0   | × 3   |
|  0-4   | × 2   |
|  5-9   | × 1.5 |
|  10-14  | × 1   |
|  15-19  | × .9  |
|  20-24  | × .8  |
|  25-29  | × .7  |
|  >30  | × .6  |

## Sample Hirelings

The following is a list of example mercenary companies you might choose to include in your campaign, and that give a good idea of how to use the rules at the beginning of the guide.

---

**The Raiders of the Bound.** A spellsword mercenary company led by Naadiya el-Abdo, the **master of swords**, and Zaahira al-Sharifi, the **master of spells**, both neutral female humans. Under their command are two **spellsword sergeants**, two **war mages**, four **skirmishers**, four **spellswords**, and sixteen **bandits** (see end of document for statistics). Though they can be contracted in groups of as little as 7 (one **spellsword seargeant** or **war mage**, one **skirmisher**, one **spellsword**, and four **bandits**) at a cost of 8 gp/day, they prefer to fight as a whole (including the two leaders), and provide a substantial discount (80 gp/day, 20-day minimum) if this can be arranged.

---

**The Bland Band Adventuring Party.** A painfully stereotypical but good-hearted group of adventurers, for hire on tasks great and small. They include Robert, a neutral good human **veteran**; Urist, a lawful good dwarf **priest**; Primrose, a chaotic neutral halfling **spy**; and Anastrianna, a neutral elf **adept mage**. They accept payment only as a group, and charge 18 gp/day with no minimum term of service.

---

**Circle of the Shaewood.** A close-knit circle of druids that join together twice a year at the vernal and autumnal equinoxes. During this time, they accept assignments in accord with their ethos that last no longer than three months. The circle consists of one **archdruid**, four **ovates** (two of which can Change Shape), eight **druids**, and eight **aspirants**. All members charge twice the normal rate for their CR by default (using the minimum term of the highest-CR individual), or three times the normal rate if hired in groups that cost less than 50 gp/day. If more than half of the circle is required for a task, they require that the entire circle be commissioned. Hiring the entire circle costs 550 gp/day, and has a minimum term of twenty days.

---

**Goblinoid Shock Unit.** A standard hobgoblin-run mercenary unit. A **hobgoblin captain** leads ten **hobgoblins**, twenty **goblins**, five **bugbears**, two **ogres**, and four **half-ogres**. They except payment only as a single unit, at a cost of 50 gp/day with a minimum term of five days.

**Adept mages** are wizards well along the path to being true mages. Some still serve as students of more powerful wizards, while other have struck out on their own with their meager arcane powers. Full disclosure, this statblock is similar to an evil mage (from the Mines of Phandelver adventure) stripped of its evil-ey stuff.

The creature can add a d6 to its roll provided it can hear and understand the knight. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time. This effect ends if the knight is incapacitated.
>
> ### Reactions

> ***Parry.*** The knight adds 3 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the knight must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.

**Elite knights** are noble warriors of martial might. Stronger in arm and heart than the average knight, an elite knight might command an entire squadron of knights and other warriors.

**Sorcerers** are arcane masters no less than wizards. Unlike the mage, the sorcerer cannot change its list of prepared spells. Some sorcerers accentuate their natural charms with arcane powers and are known as **enchantresses** (to distinguish them from the wizardly enchanter). These casters have an AC of 12, +9 bonus to Deception, Intimidation, and Persuasion checks, +5 to Sleight of Hand checks, +3 to Insight checks, and the following trait and alternate spell list:

---

***Subtle Spell.*** When the enchantress casts a spell, it can cast the spell without any somatic or verbal components.

---

***Spellcasting.*** The enchantress is a 9th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). The enchantress has the following sorcerer spells prepared:

---

Cantrips (at will):

Some **ovates** can take animal form, and have the following action option:

---

***Change Shape (2/Day).*** The ovate magically polymorphs into a beast with a challenge rating of 2 or less, and can remain in this form for up to 6 hours. The ovate can choose whether its equipment falls to the ground, melds with its new form, or is worn by the new form. The ovate reverts to its true form if it dies or falls unconscious. The ovate can revert to its true form using a bonus action on its turn.  
&nbsp; &nbsp; While in a new form, the ovate retains its game statistics and ability to speak, but its AC, movement modes, Strength, and Dexterity are replaced by those of the new form, and it gains any special senses, proficiencies, traits, actions, and reactions (except class features, legendary actions, and lair actions) that the new form has but that it lacks.  
&nbsp; &nbsp; The new form's attacks count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistances and immunity to nonmagical attacks.
