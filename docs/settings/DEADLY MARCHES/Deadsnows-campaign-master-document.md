1    | Adventurer                     | 1-4    | Вы не боитесь риска, крови и опасностей. Возможно, вами движет страсть к туго набитому золотыми монетами кошельку или жажда справедливости. В любом случае, сидеть на месте и заниматься рутиной явно не для вас. Вы хотите действия.                                                                                                                                  | None
2    | Seasoned Adventurer or Veteran | 5-8    | Каждую ночь ноют шрамы, полученные вами в жестоких схватках с чудовищами и  опасностями окружаюшего вас мира, но через ваши руки прошло ценностей уже больше, чем многие крестьяне видели за всю свою жизнь. Вас узнают на улицах, и пускай пока не Глубоководья, но это только начало. Хотя иногда вечерами вы грустите за своими товарищами, которых уже нет с вами. | None

# Отдых и восстановление

## Длинный отдых

Длинный отдых - 8 часов в безопасных условиях (тайной стоянке или поселении).

A long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long, during which you sleep or perform light activity: reading, talking, eating, or standing watch for no more than 2 hours of the rest period. If the rest is interrupted by a strenuous activity—such as attacking, taking damage, or casting a spell—you must start the rest over to gain any benefit from it, unless the interruption takes less than an hour.

You must have at least 1 hit point to take a long rest. At the end of the rest, you regain all your hit points and half of your maximum number of Hit Dice (round up].

You cannot benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period.

## Short Rest

A short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, during which you catch your breath, eat, drink, and clean and bind wounds.
You can spend one or more of your Hit Dice during a short rest, up to your maximum number of Hit Dice. For each Hit Die you spend in this way, roll the die and add your Constitution modifier to it. You regain hit points equal to the total. You can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll. Once you have spent all your Hit Dice, you must complete a long rest to regain them.


## Восстановление хит-поинтов

### Медленное природное лечение - Slow Natural Healing
Characters don't regain hit points at the end of a long rest. Instead, a character can spend Hit Dice to heal at the end of a long rest, just as with a short rest.

### Healer's Kit Dependency
A character can't spend any Hit Dice after finishing a short rest until someone expends one use of a healer's kit to bandage and treat the character's wounds.

# Outfits - simple system

## Design Goals

1) Provide structure to the gameplay elements assosiated with clothes.
2) Retain the design phylosophy of 5e by making the rules simple and easy to use.
3) Make the rules streamlined in order to easily implement them in any campaign and reduce the bookkeeping to a minimum.
4) Make the rules modular and adjustable so that DMs and Players can easily come up with new outfits on the fly.

## What is an outfit?

An outfit is a set of clothes that a creature wears at any given time. You don't track each individual article of clothing on your person just like you don't track elements of your armor. You can wear only one outfit at a time.

Each outfit has a number of properties that distinguish it from other outfits. There are three mandatory properties: Size, Lifestyle and Culture. Also, an outfit may have unlimited number of optional properties, which may have gameplay effects. 

## Mandatory Properties

### Size

The size of an outfit can be tiny, small, medium, huge or gargantuan. A creature of one size can not wear the outfit designed for a creature of another size. For example, a warrior's outfit made for a medium sized human will not fit a small halfling. This property affect the base price of the outfit as shown in the table 

*Outfit prices per size*

tiny - 1/2 of the base price
small - 1x of the base price
medium - 1x of the base price
large - 2x of the base price
huge - 4x of the base price
gargantuan - 8x of the base price

***Optional Rule. Outfit sizes within the same category.*** Outfit sizes within the same category.  When adventurers find clothing, they might need to visit a tailor, leatherworker, or similar expert to make the outfit wearable. The cost for such work varies from 10 to 40 percent of the market price of the item. The DM can either roll 1d4 × 10 or determine the increase in cost based on the extent of the alterations required. Otherwise, a creature can wear the outfit but it will have disadvantage on Dexterity checks and Saving Throws.

### Lifestyle

People will be judged and appreciated by what they wear so dressing according to one's lifestyle can facilitate communication depending on what your goals are.

An outfit can be wretched, squalid, poor, modest, comfortable, wealthy or aristocratic. This property determines the base cost of an outfit as shown in the table *Base Costs of Outfits*.

***Wretched***. This outfit is ruined and serves only to cover nakedness. Slaves, poorest beggars and creatures who disregard their clothes wear wretched outfits.

***Squalid.*** This outfit could feature cheap second-hand garments and well-worn footwear. People on the brink of poverty, prisoners, beggars wear squalid outfits.

***Poor.*** This outfit could feature simple and homemade items such as roughspun shirts, trousers and skirts. Pilgrims, landless peasants, unskilled workers wear poor outfits.

***Modest***. This outfit could include adequately designed garments made of materials easily available in the area. Peasants, servants, militia soldiers, lower clergymen, ordinary workers, craftsmen wear modest outfits.

***Comfortable***. This outfit could feature well-designed pieces of clothing made of good quality local materials with decorative parts made of expensive materials such as silk or animal fur. Generally speaking, this outfit gives its wearer the impression of a well-off person. Professionals, artisans, scholars, owners of small businesses, clergymen and many adventurers wear comfortable outfits.

***Wealthy***. This outfit could feature richly decorated items of clothing made from good quality material designed for higher social stratas. Successful merchants, high clergymen, guild masters, prosperous artisans, knights in service of a wealthy master and lesser nobles wear wealthy outfits. 

***Aristocratic***. This outfit usually includes several items made from rare and exotic materials and accompanied by a good amount of high quality jewelry. Nobles, royal families, heads of states and the wealthiest members of a society wear aristocratic outfits. 

*Base cost of an outfit associated with a specific lifestyle*

Lifestyle    | Outfit cost, gp
-------------|----------------
Wretched     | 0
Squalid      | 1
Poor         | 2
Modest       | 9
Comfortable  | 18
Wealthy      | 36
Aristocratic | 90
 
### Culture

An outfit almost always represents a culture in which it was designed. A waterdhavian noble finery is very different from an elven noble outfit of Evereska. A character may choose to dress appropriately depending on where the character is. This property may increase the base cost of an outfit by 2-4 times if its culture property is different from the culture of the place where this outfit was aquired. This represents the cost of import/export and rarity of such outifts in the market.

***Sample Cultures***: Sword Coast, Waterdeep, Evereska, Uthgardt, Northern Dwarven, Calishite, Moonshae, Halruua, Wood Elves of the High Forest, Orcs of Many-Arrows.

## Optional properties

**Faction**

An outfit can represent its wearer as part of a faction. It can be a uniform or an outfit with distinguishing features that members of that faction recognize. A person wearing a faction outfit may pass as a member of that faction. This property doesn't affect the base cost of an outfit.

**Weather**

An outfit can be made specifically for wearing it during certain weather conditions. It is usually cold weather resistant or hot weather resistant but a DM can create or improvise outfits designed against other weather conditions, be they natural or not. This property increases the base outfit cost by 3 times representing rare designs or amount of materials needed to make it.

**Armor padding**

This outfit is suited for wearing it with metallic medium and heavy armor. The outfit must be assosiated with poor lifestyle or higher to benefit from the armor padding property. This property increases the base cost of an outfit by 2 times and represents the amount of materials used to make it.

**Sex**

An outfit can be designed for a male, female or both. A person wearing an outfit that is clearly designed for a different sex may be uncomfortable to wear or attract unwanted attention depending on the social norms in the area. If no property is mentioned, the outfit is assumed to be suited for all sexes. This property doesn't affect the base cost of an outift.

**Unconventional** 

This outfit consists of pieces of clothing that challenge the social norms of a society, or is designed to attract attention for one purpose or another. Performers, street magicians, people with rebellious tendencies usually wear unconventional outfits.

**Mixed and Matched** 

This outfit consits of pieces of clothing assosiated with different social classes and styles which makes it difficult to predict what class the wearer belongs to.

## Creating optional properties

It is easy to create new optional properties for an outfit. Think about what make a certain outfit special, assign a name for this property and give a quick description.

## Gameplay effects of properties

Benefits or penalties of properties can be assigned by a DM on individual basis. Think about what seems appropriate to the situation and assign benefits or penalties accordingly. For example, wearing an Aristocratic Calishite Unconventional outfit in the slums of Waterdeep may attract attention of local thiefs and thugs who might try to rob the character. Wearing beggar's rugs will insure that you won't get access to an aristocratic tavern. Wearing an outfit adorned with goblin heads and skulls may grant advantage to intimidation checks against them.
Determine the mechanical benefits or penalties by talking to your players or making a desicion on your own.

## Wearing armor and outfits.

You can wear wear one outfit and one set of armor at a time. If you wear a set of armor without an outfit you suffer the penalties as if you were not proficient with the armor due to lack of comfort.

*If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can't cast spells.*

## Selling outfits

Selling clothing follows the same rules as other mundane equipment. If it was not worn or used, it can be sold for 50% of its cost.  In other cases it may be too damaged or worn to sell unless the DM rules otherwise.

## Outfit formatting

**Name**
*[Size] [Lifestyle] Outfit: [culture property]; [optional properties]. [price]*

# Litercay and languages

**Literacy:** Among the human populace literacy is not a given. In fact, for the majority of the populace “knowing your letters” is a rarity. It is not uncommon for someone to be able to speak many languages and simply be unable to read or write in any of them. As such literacy has become a soft social meter which displays either tutoring or noble blood.

There are four ways to gain literacy; race, background ,giving up a known language, or aquiring the linguist feat.

Both dwarves and elorii have strong traditions of education and gain literacy through their racial heritage. Some backgrounds grant literacy and if you choose a background which oes not grant literacy you may become literate by giving up one of your known languages.

# Modified Three Pillar

This version of three pillar experience rewards players for exploration and social interaction, while maintaining the traditional character advancement scale and allowing the GM to reward XP for encounters.

Instead of rewarding a fixed amount, for Exploration and Social Interaction players receive a percentage of the XP required for them to get from their current level to the next \(calculated from the base XP of their level to the next, not including XP they've earned in between.\)

They may receive a higher or lower percentage depending on the their tier of play compared to the magnitude of their accomplishment.

Main goals for receiving experience points: exploring, get friends and allies and survive in combats.


## Gaining Levels

Players gain levels according to the normal PHB Character Advancement table.

| XP      | Level | XP to Next Level |
|---------|-------|------------------|
| 0       | 1     | 300              |
| 300     | 2     | 600              |
| 900     | 3     | 1,800            |
| 2,700   | 4     | 3,800            |
| 6,500   | 5     | 7,500            |
| 14,000  | 6     | 9,000            |
| 23,000  | 7     | 11,000           |
| 34,000  | 8     | 14,000           |
| 48,000  | 9     | 16,000           |
| 64,000  | 10    | 21,000           |
| 85,000  | 11    | 15,000           |
| 100,000 | 12    | 20,000           |

| 140,000 | 14    | 25,000           |
| 165,000 | 15    | 30,000           |
| 195,000 | 16    | 30,000           |
| 225,000 | 17    | 40,000           |
| 265,000 | 18    | 40,000           |
| 302,000 | 19    | 50,000           |
| 355,000 | 20    | See Epic Boons   |

## Dividing XP

For Exploration and Social Interaction, the XP award for an adventure is the same for each member of the party, instead of being divided among them.

     However, this does not mean the XP is awarded for individual merit. XP is awarded when the party as a whole accomplishes something, without splitting hairs about who contributed to what the most.   

## Experience for Exploring Interactions

### Pillar 1: Exploration

For discovering both Items and Locations, each player gains 5% at their tier, 5% additional for every tier above, none for below their tier.   

#### Items

In this version, players are rewarded for discovering magic items that are of the highest nonconsumable rarity suggested for their tier as per Xanathar's Guide.

| Tier | Requirements to rarity or cost                                                |
|------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | A single art object or gem worth 100 gp or more, or a major uncommon item     |
| 2    | A single art object or gem worth 1,000 gp or more, or a major rare item       |
| 3    | A single art object or gem worth 5,000 gp or more, or a major very rare item  |
| 4    | A single art object or gem worth 50,000 gp or more, or a major legendary item |

#### Locations

A location's tier depends on the importance to your campaign, measured by the scope of its discovery or liberation's impact:
| Tier | Location importance                             |
|------|-------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | A location important to a small town or village |
| 2    | A location vital to a kingdom                   |
| 3    | A location important across the region          |
| 4    | A location of continent importance              |
| 5    | A location of planet importance                 |

## Experience for Social Interactions

### Pillar 2: Social Interaction

#### NPCs

Players gain XP for turning important NPCs into allies, aligning them with their cause or denying them as assets to their enemies. The XP they gain is based on the NPC's power and influence.

      Each player gains 5% at their tier, 5% additional for every tier above, 2% for below their tier.

| Tier | NPC influence                                                                              |
|------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | An NPC with influence over a small town or village, or the equivalent                      |
| 2    | An NPC with influence over a city or the equivalent                                        |
| 3    | An NPC with influence over a kingdom, continent, or the equivalent                         |
| 4    | An NPC \(including a deity\) with cosmic significance or influence across multiple worlds. |
| 5    | An NPC \(including a deity\) with cosmic significance or influence across multiple worlds. |

#### Role Play

This modified Three Pillar method also rewards players for inter-party role play. The difficulty of inter-party role play should remain fairly constant throughout all tiers of play, so unlike the other categories in this method it is not awarded based on tier. Instead, it is awarded for specific group activities.

When the party interacts in character during a session, each member gains 5%. If the interaction is only partially in character, they gain 2%. If they create a story-changing or divergent moment, they gain an extra 5%.

Here are some examples of these interactions \(obviously party interaction situations are not limited to these\):

The party argues in character.

The party comes to a decision in character.

The party solves a mystery or puzzle in character.

Some party members conspire to play a trick on another party member

Some party members confront other party members about a problem or secret.

The party convinces an NPC to give them information that the NPC previously did not want to give, a significantly lower price on an item, or another form of important help.

More than half the party gains inspiration or role plays their TBIFs.

The party agrees to take a quest from an NPC in need.   

## Experience for Combat Interactions

### Pillar 3: Combat

Players gain 85% of the encounter XP, rounding decimals down, divided between them and any NPCs that contributed. This is used for combats, traps, and puzzles which award XP.

TBD

# Pregenerated characters

# Rumors and bonds - class and background specific

# Factions

Disfavor with a faction imposes disadvantage on all Charisma (Persuasion) and Charisma (Intimidate) skill checks made with that faction. In the case of Favors with large groups, you only gain this penalty when interacting with those of high station such as a general, a king, or the patriarch of a patrician family associated with that power.

* You may use a Favor to cancel a Disfavor from the same faction. This voids both the Favor and Disfavor immediately.

* You may spend a Favor with a given faction/group/individual (at GM’s discussion) to gain the benefits of a one-time expenditure of 3 fame with that faction/group/individual. You may spend two favors with the same factionBto gain the benefits of a 5-point fame expenditure.

## Factions

Важный момент. Члены фракция делятся на регуляров и нерегуляров. Регулярные члены фракции работают за деньги на фракцию и получают урезанные бенефиты. Нерегуляры обладают большей свободой, и в зависимости от ситуации могут даже отказаться от задания.

Конкретная реализация зависит в каждом случае от конкретной игры, мастера, игрока и задания.
Пример. Белдора Арфист в СКТ - регуляр.

Персонажи в Лунном море и приключениях сезонных Лиги - регуляры.

Персонаж арфист в ОоотА, СКТ, Принцах Апокалипсиса - не регуляр.

# Character retirement  - Отставка персонажа и "выход на пенсию"

Взамен персонажа, который отправился на пенсию, игрок может создать персонажа с уровнем равным половине уровня персонажа - отставника с капиталом в размере 50 зм на уровень

# Tasks and Skills

## New tools proficiency

Mounts (land) - умение ездить верхом и управлять верховыми животными.

Mounts (air) - умение управлять летающими верховыми животными.

## Strength

### Athletics.

You might make a Strength (Athletics] check in difficult situations encountered while climbing, jumping, or swimming. Here are examples:

•	You attempt to climb a sheer or slippery cliff, avoid hazards while scaling a wall, or cling to a surface while something is trying to knock you off.
•	You try to jump an unusually long distance or pull off a stunt midjump.
•	You struggle to swim or stay afloat in treacherous currents, storm-tossed waves, or areas of thick seaweed. Or another creature tries to push or pull you underwater or otherwise interfere with your swimming.

Check DC	Climbing Examples	Jumping Examples	Swimming Examples
5	Climbing a steep hill or slope.	Making your normal jump distance with a running start.	Swimming through calm waters.
10	Climbing a tree or a steep, rough incline.	Jumping 5 feet further or 2 feet higher than normal with a running start, or avoiding a low ceiling or waist-high obstacle during a long jump.	Swimming through rough waters.
15	Climbing a tall pole or totem, or dungeon- or ruin-style stone walls.	Jumping your long jump distance without a running start, or jumping 10 feet further or 4 feet higher than normal with a running start.	Swimming through stormy waters.
20	Climbing a brick wall or rock cliff.	Jumping 15 feet further or 6 feet higher than normal with a running start.	Swimming up a fast- moving river.
25	Climbing a tall, sheer cliff, or a wall made of shaped stone.	Jumping twice your normal jump distance with a running start.	Swim through a giant whirlpool.
30	Climbing a wall of force.	Jumping twice your normal jump distance without a running start, or three times as much with a running start.	Swimming up a waterfall.
The DC for a given climbing example increases by 5 if the surface is slick with liquid but decreases by 5 if you have decent handholds or a properly-secured rope.

Climbing, jumping, and swimming should remain purely in the playhouse of Strength. Dexterity and the Acrobatics skill should not be applied to these given activities, to keep Strength a relevant, obvious solution to problems these can solve.
Example DCs can be found in the Athletics DCs table.
Climbing. Scaling an incline is an easy task that should not require an ability check, even a steep one given generous handholds. Failure should not mean a deadly fall. A Dexterity saving throw of a lesser DC can sometimes be allowed to stay in place. In most cases, failing simply causes one to slide back down unless under immediate duress and threat of injury.
Calling for a check at all is only really required if the situation is appropriately dangerous. An entire party could scale a steep cliff without much effort, so long as there is nothing nipping at their heels or waiting at the top for them.
Jumping. The Athletics skill states that it can be used to jump unusually long distances. Only call for such a check if a character could not make it with their default jumping distance, detailed in the rules for movement.
 

## Dexterity

### Acrobatics

Make a Dexterity (Acrobatics] check to balance when you try to keep your feet in a tricky situation, such as when you’re trying to run across a sheet of ice, balance on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking ship’s deck. The DM might also call for a Dexterity (Acrobatics] check to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.

Acrobatics is not a replacement for the Athletics skill. Instead, it has very specific implementations that are usually done passively or as part of some other action: keeping one’s balance, slipping out of tight spaces, and of course performing acrobatic stunts.
ACROBATICS DCS
Check DC	Situation
5	Walk in a straight line with your arms out to either side.
10	Keep one's footing on an icy surface in combat.
15	Perform a standing backflip, or walk across a tightrope.
20	Perform a quadruple somersault during a jump.
25	Cartwheel across a tightrope.
30	Walk across a frictionless surface.

### Sleight of Hand

Whenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting something on someone else or concealing an object on your person, make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand] check. You can also draw small weapons without alerting anyone that you have done so, such as when palming a knife or sliding darts out of your sleeve. And the DM might call for a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand] check to determine whether you can lift a coin purse off another person or slip something out of another person’s pocket.

This skill could, in many ways, simply be combined with the Stealth skill. However, it still does have its uses and can come up in play, if not all that often. This will mostly occur through the Steal action, but Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks can be used for pulling magic tricks or carefully manipulating small objects.
Like the Stealth skill, Sleight of Hand is almost always opposed by a creature’s Wisdom (Perception) check or passive Perception score, with almost no exceptions. A soft DC 10 can be used to perform some simple acts of manual trickery, such as using a fishhook and line to grab a set of keys from a jail cell.

### Stealth

Make a Dexterity (Stealth] check when you attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on someone without being seen or heard.
Stealth is perhaps the most well-defined skill in Dungeons & Dragons. It is used for anything involving stealth, and it is always contested by a creature’s Wisdom (Perception) check or passive Perception score.
To smooth play, do not call for repeated Dexterity (Stealth) checks when a character is simply moving through an area. Instead, only ask for another check if the character is spotted or performs a specific action that could break their stealth. A Dexterity (Stealth) check of 17 could get a creature past most guards and sentries, even passing across doorways or moving within a few feet of an unaware guard. However, once a character attempts to take out a guard or after a character activates a trap, a second check may be worthwhile, as the situation can change dramatically.

### Other

The DM might call for a Dexterity check when you try to accomplish one of these tasks:
•	Keep a trap from functioning
•	Control a heavily laden cart on a steep descent
•	Steer a chariot around a tight turn or obstacle
•	Pick a lock
•	Stay in the saddle of a rearing horse
•	Securely tie up a prisoner
•	Wriggle free of bonds

## Constitution

Constitution checks are uncommon, because the endurance this ability represents is largely passive rather than involving a specific effort on the part of a creature. A Constitution check can model a creature’s attempt to push beyond normal limits, however. No skills apply to Constitution checks.
The DM might call for a Constitution check when a character tries to accomplish one of these tasks:
•	Hold his or her breath
•	March for hours without rest
•	Go without sleep
•	Survive without food or water
•	Quaff an entire stein of ale in one go
•	Roll down a steep slope without taking damage

## Intelligence

An Intelligence check comes into play when a creature needs to draw on logic, education, memory, or deductive reasoning. The Arcana, History, Nature, Religion, and Search skills apply to some Intelligence checks.
During the course of an adventure, players may encounter things that their characters may know about, but which they do not. Doing this makes heavy use of Intelligence- based skills (Arcana, History, Nature, and Religion especially).
Usually these checks are made without much trouble. When a player wants to know about a creature during combat, however, combat can be slowed down. To make a check to recall information about a creature, an object, or anything else, a character must use their action or reaction to do so.
A check to identify a creature and its general strengths has a DC of 10 + half the creature’s CR. This increases by 5 if the creature is not from the Material Plane. Succeeding by 5 or more also recalls some or all of the creature’s specific abilities and weaknesses.

### Arcana

A character might make an Intelligence (Arcana] check to recall lore about spells, magic items, eldritch symbols, magical traditions, the planes of existence, or the inhabitants of those planes.

The Arcana skill is not just for recalling information about magic, identifying spells and such. It can be used to figure out how a magical device functions, or to disable magical traps. Given the nature of Dungeons & Dragons’ settings, the Arcana skill should have plenty of instances to shine.
Arcana is also the most versatile knowledge skill when it comes to monsters. It can be used to recall information about the abilities of most aberrations, celestials, most constructs, elementals, fey, fiends, monstrosities created by magic, some oozes, and most undead, as Arcana covers knowledge about spells, magic, and the planes all in one.
ARCANA DCS
Check DC	Situation
Varies	Identify a spell, either as it's being cast or by its effects (DC 10 + the spell's level).
5	Recognize that an effect is magical.
10	Determine whether a creature or object is magical in origin, and recall information about it if it's common.
15	Recognize the type of magic of an effect (whether it's of arcane, divine, psionic, or some other type of origin). Recall the common inhabitants of another plane of existence, or recognize the influence of another plane on an area.
20	Recall information related to a legendary item or artifact's origin and powers, or about the state and effects of another plane of existence.

### History

A character might make an Intelligence (History] check to recall lore about historical events, legendary people, ancient kingdoms, past disputes, recent wars, or lost civilizations.


Unlike Arcana, History is dedicated almost entirely to recalling information. Its use is quite specific as well. In a pinch, the skill can be used past its normal intentions to recall information about the local region, such as local nobles, recent battles, and local feuds or problems.
It can also be used to recall information about particularly impactful monsters. Information about dragons, giants, and humanoids tends to fit best in the History skill. Depending on the setting, it may help recall information about other monsters, such as the role of aberrations in Eberron.

Check DC	Situation
5	Recall common information about the recent past.
10	Recall uncommon information about events in the last 5 years.
15	Recall hidden information about the last century.
20	Recall hidden information about the last millennium, or information about something purposely destroyed or wiped from most historical records.
25	Recall hidden information about the distant past, so long as it was recorded in some way.
30	Recall, in perfect detail, any event from the distant past.


### Nature

A character might make an Intelligence (Nature] check to recall lore about terrain, plants and animals, the weather, or natural cycles.

Nature is one of the wider Intelligence skills, usable in a host of situations, especially to recall information about beasts, the wilder dragons, many fey, primal humanoids, common monstrosities, and of course plants.
In some cases, Wisdom (Nature) checks may be appropriate. Consider allowing these for rangers and druids, who are close to nature but whose Intelligence scores are generally not all that high.
NATURE DCS Check DC Situation
5	Identify common plants and animals.
10	Recall that a neighboring desert is infamous for its ice storms, or that the local forest is guarded by vengeful fey.
15	Determine that a storm is artificial, that a cliff face is actually an unnatural façade, or that a specific animal usually isn't found in the area.
20	Identify that a creature is one-of-a- kind or possibly a new species.
25	Pinpoint the depth and epicenter of an earthquake from eyewitness reports.
30	Determine that a nearby mountain is going to erupt within the next few days.

### Religion

A character might make an Intelligence (Religion] #check to recall lore about deities, rites and prayers, ecclesiastical hierarchies, holy symbols, or the practices of secret cults.

Religion is the narrowest of the Intelligence skills. DMs coming from older editions often use it beyond its stated scope, though this has little impact on the game itself. In truth, Intelligence (Religion) checks may rarely come up in a game not involved with cults or religious organizations.
That’s not to say it’s completely useless. It can be used to recall information on many celestials, fiends, and some undead, as they relate to cults and deities.
RELIGION DCS


Check DC	Situation
5	Recognize holy symbols of common deities.
10	Recall the rites and major traditions of common religions, enough to fit in at a church.
15	Determine which deity or cult an ancient ruin was dedicated to, or recall information on local mythology.
20	Recognize the secret symbols and actions of cultists hiding their dealings in plain sight.
25	Recognize the symbols and myths of a god dead and buried for 10,000 years.
30	Improvise the proper rites of a long- dead religion to contact its sleeping god.

### Invvestigation

When you look around for clues that point to a hidden object, such as a trap or secret door, or hints of a creature’s passage through an area, you make an Intelligence (Search] check.

This skill is the “black sheep” of the fifth edition skill system. Often confused with Perception in its use, the difference between the two is often vague, both in rules and in various official adventures.
The best way to illustrate this is with a common Dungeons & Dragon element: traps. Perception can be used to spot a trap. You can see the shine of torchlight on a trip 
wire, or the slight separation between stones indicating a pressure plate. Investigation allows you to figure out how a trap works. It lets you notice that the trip wire is likely attached something that comes down from the slots in the ceiling, or that the pressure plate likely has to do with the holes in the walls.
It may also be better to think about them in terms of scale. Perception is for things that are obvious, out in the open. You could notice them at a glance, given a high enough awareness. Investigation is for seeing smaller-scale things, such as that a single book in a bookcase is out of place, with a different subject than the others.
Like Insight, Investigation can be used by DMs to move a campaign along. If players have found clues but aren’t connecting them, an Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Investigation) check may help them put 2 and 2 together.
INVESTIGATION DCS
Check DC	Situation
5	Notice that one person in a lineup is of a different race than the others.
10	Determine the weakest pillar holding up an aging ruin's ceiling, or notice that one person in a crowd has a limp.
15	Determine that a letter contains a secret message, or pour over a text and find a specific passage quickly.
20	Find the single brick in a wall that, when pushed, opens a secret door.
25	Spot a secret message hidden in the specific wording of an ancient text.
30	Find a needle in a haystack.

### Other

The DM might call for an Intelligence check when a character tries to accomplish one of these tasks:
•	Communicate with a creature without words
•	Deduce what kind of weapon caused an injury
•	Estimate the value of a precious item
•	Pull together a disguise to help an ally pass as a city guard
•	Determine how to cause part of a tunnel to collapse
•	Pass off a forged document as real

## Wisdom

### Animal Handling

When there is any question whether you can calm down a domesticated animal, keep your mount from getting spooked, or intuit an animal’s intentions, make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check.

Animal Handling sees perhaps the least use in most campaigns. If someone takes it, try to give them a few chances to use it, even if it’s only once or twice every few sessions.
 
ANIMAL HANDLING DCS
Check DC	Situation
5	Command a healthy, trained animal to do a trick it knows.
10	Command a healthy, trained animal to do a trick it doesn't know, or to put itself in harm's way.
15	Get an untrained animal to do what you want, for its benefit.
20	Get an untrained animal to attack an enemy or otherwise put itself in harm's way.
25	Get an injured and untrained animal to put itself in harm's way.
30	Command a cat to bark.

If the check is made under external threats, such as during combat or while avoiding an ongoing lava flow, increase the DC by 5. Having something the animal wants (especially food) can give a character advantage on the check.

### Perception

You might make a Wisdom (Perception] check to spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. For example, you might try to hear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, or hear creatures moving stealthily toward you in the forest. Or you might try to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, whether they are orcs lying in ambush ahead of you on a road, thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed secret door.


Being one of the most-used skills, Perception needs little encouragement in its use. Perception is also the one skill focused on for passive scores. For NPCs, passive Perception use is a must to speed up play, but for characters, encouraging regular active use of the Perception skill can keep play active. While some say to use passive Perception as a hard minimum for Wisdom (Perception) checks, it can be useful to completely ignore it for active checks where failure could be more interesting, exciting, or dangerous.
PERCEPTION DCS
Check DC	Situation
5	Hear people talking in the next room, or see someone walking in the trees.
10	Hear people whispering in the next room.
15	Read the lips of someone across the room.

Check DC	Situation
20	Hear and understand whispers from a
	room over, or see the telltale signs of a
	secret door.
25	Hear an owl gliding in for a kill.
30	See the outline of an invisible creature.

### Insight

When you attempt to determine the true intentions of another person, such as when searching out a lie or predicting someone’s next move, you can make a Wisdom (Insight] check. Doing so involves gleaning clues from body language, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.

Insight is yet another skill used in contests more often than flat checks. Unlike NPCs, PCs do not get situational bonuses to their Wisdom (Insight) checks, instead relying on the player’s own wit. However, in a pinch with no leads, a character can make a DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check to get a hunch that something is amiss or not. If the DM so 
decides, he or she may provide the player with some sort of hint to go along with the hunch, such as “People’s eyes keep glancing at the beautiful tapestry on the far wall” to denote that people might be hiding something.
On a failed check to notice an NPC’s bluff, the DM should be careful not to show their hand. Too often, even a failed check can tell the player that their suspicions are at least partially correct, instead of revealing little or no information. When describing a failure to detect a bluff, try to say that a character has trouble getting a good read on the NPC, rather than saying that the character finds the NPC trustworthy.

### Survival

A character might make a Wisdom (Survival] check to hunt wild game, guide a party safely through frozen wastelands, identify signs that owlbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards.
.
urvival is yet another well-defined skill. The guidelines in the Dungeon Master’s Guide on foraging, navigation, and tracking all give solid DCs on the skill’s use.
When cook’s utensils aren’t available (or a character isn’t proficient in with them), Wisdom (Survival) checks can be used to determine if a proper meal is prepared by an unskilled chef. A DC of 10 is usually more than enough to produce something edible from wild game and plants, with a 15 or 20 giving a much-needed morale boost in the wilderness in the form of a delicious, if gamey, meal. This morale boost can be presented by temporary hit points, usually 1d4.


### Medicine

When you try to stabilize a dying companion or quickly diagnose what common illness is afflicting him or her, you make a Wisdom (Medicine] check.

Yet another underused skill, Medicine can have more uses than just stabilizing a dying ally in combat. Medicine can be used in place of other Intelligence-based checks to recall information and determine the nature of poisons and diseases, especially when they are affecting a creature. In many cases, Intelligence (Medicine) checks are even more apt than Wisdom (Medicine) checks, though medicine in D&D is often based on gut-feelings rather than the modern method of rote learning.
MEDICINE DCS
Check DC	Situation
5	Determine that someone has a cold. Recall how to treat common ailments.
10	Identify fresh wounds and determine how they were made in most cases.
15	Determine the exact cause of death of the recently deceased. Determine how to treat a rare poison or disease.
20	Identify a specific poison or disease by only cursory descriptions or symptoms.


Check DC	Situation
25	Find the cure or treatment for a magical disease.
30	Raise a creature that has recently died not through magic but your skill alone.

### Other Wisdom Checks

The DM might call for a Wisdom check when a character tries to accomplish one of these tasks:
•	Figure out the direction to a source of moving air while underground
•	Discern whether a seemingly dead or living creature is undead
•	Sense the true direction of an echoing sound

## Charisma

Charisma checks and their corresponding skills can be a point of contention. Firstly, they are not a replacement for roleplaying—trying to get one’s point across and interacting with an NPC should be a precursor to any Charisma check in situations that are not simply handwaved during shopping, downtime, or other bookkeeping tasks.

Charisma checks are often better treated as a way to see how a situation pans out, in a more meta sense. A 
high Charisma (Persuasion) check, even with poor reasoning beforehand, can simply show that an NPC is willing to give the character the benefit of the doubt. A poor Charisma (Intimidation) roll, even if the odds are stacked against the NPC, may reveal that the NPC has a sudden boost of morale from a secret plan he or she has. And a poor Charisma (Deception) check, even if what the PC said is totally believable, may show that the NPC is simply a suspicious type who has a nose for danger.
In this way, Charisma can be seen not just as force of will in a direct sense, but a type of social luck—the ability for things to go well for a player character. After all, luck is an important skill to have as an adventurer.

Charisma checks with NPCs are usually contested by Wisdom (Insight) checks. To avoid undue rolling and putting the need for luck on the players’ shoulders, it is usually best to use the NPC’s passive Insight score. Depending on the situation and the actions of the character, this score can be modified. Use the Insight Modifiers table as a guideline. Try to limit the modifiers to 2 or less: one for the NPC’s attitude toward the character, and another for the situation.

### Persuassion

When you attempt to influence someone or a group of people with your tact, social graces, or good nature, make a Charisma (Persuasion] check. Typically, you attempt to persuade someone when you are acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of persuading others include convincing a chamberlain to let you see the king, negotiating peace between warring tribes, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.

The last of the three major Charisma skills, Persuasion is also the most-used. Influencing an NPC to do what you want is an important skill to have! As such, it is often opposed by an NPC’s passive Insight score, with adjustments based on the attitude of the NPC as given in the Insight Modifiers table in the previous section.

In this case, using the Insight score might not make sense, at first. Just like Intimidation, consider the Insight score as a way to represent not only the ability to detect lies but a sort of luck created by situational awareness. A creature with a large bonus to Wisdom (Insight) checks is more likely to foresee negative outcomes to doing what the party wants or even associating with them.

The DM should try to only call for Charisma (Persuasion) checks when the NPC in question wouldn’t perform or refuse to perform the action in question. A close ally may already give their life for the party, but a villain will surely reject any requests the party makes that don’t fit their fell fancy.

Finally, the Persuasion skill can be used to handwave the gathering of rumors. Searching for information or rumors on a specific subject in a town might take a few hours and a DC 10 or 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check, allowing characters to move the story forward while others shop or rest.

### Deception

When you make a Charisma (Deception] check, you are attempting to deceive someone, either verbally or through your actions, which can encompass everything from misleading others through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fast-talk a guard, con a merchant, earn money through gambling, pass off a disguise, dull someone’s suspicions with false assurances, or maintain a straight face while telling a blatant lie.

Due to its situational nature, Deception is usually used in contests alone, opposed by an NPC’s Wisdom (Insight) check. Generally, it’s best to use passive Insight scores to set a DC for the check, with adjustments based on the attitude of the NPC. Insight in this case is used in its closest rules-as-written form, allowing an NPC to detect whether a PC is pulling their leg.

The Insight Modifiers table in the previous section contains guidelines for modifying an NPC’s Insight score to set a DC for a character’s Charisma (Deception) checks.


### Intimidation

When you attempt to influence someone through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical violence, make a Charisma (Intimidation] check. Examples of when you would intimidate another include trying to pry information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs to back down from a confrontation, or using the edge of a broken bottle to convince a sneering vizier to reconsider a decision.

Like Deception, Intimidation is often contested by a Wisdom (Insight) check or, more smoothly, an NPC’s passive Insight score. The Insight Modifiers table in the previous section contains guidelines for modifying an NPC’s Insight score to set a DC for a character’s Charisma (Intimidation) checks.

Many players attempt to use this skill in combat. While tempting, the DM should not use the frightened condition in this case, as it steps on the toes of many class features and spells. Instead, use Intimidation checks as a way to affect morale. A high Intimidation check accompanied by the slaying an opponent may cause weaker enemies to retreat. A low Intimidation check may make stronger enemies more aggressive. In either case, the Insight skill is used to represent not just a creature’s ability to read a situation but also to show their self-awareness, whether they can avoid being overcome by fear in the heat of battle or not.


### Performance

You make a Charisma (Performance] check to perform before an audience with music, dance, acting, legerdemain, storytelling, or some other form of entertainment.

### Other Charisma Checks

The DM might call for a Charisma check when a character tries to accomplish one of these tasks:
•	Find the best person to talk to for news, rumors, and gossip
•	Blend into a crowd to get the sense of key topics of conversation

## Hazards
Is there a chance that failing a task might lead to a disastrous outcome for the character? You decide whether a hazard applies to a particular ability check and when the hazard applies.

A hazard might affect a character who fails an ability check. For example, a character who attempts and fails a Strength (Athletics] check to jump across a pit that he or she couldn’t normally clear probably falls into the pit. Sometimes, though, a hazard kicks in only if the character misses the ability check’s DC (or loses a contest] by a significant margin, such as 5 or 10. 

## Requirements

A task might require a specific tool or circumstance for a character to have any chance of success. For example, you might need a magnifying glass to accurately appraise a gem.

A character who cannot meet the requirements for a task automatically fails. One who meets them can attempt an ability check as normal for the task.

## Synergy bonuses

Some tool proficiencies can give synergy bonus to specific skill use - granting advantage or negating disadvantage.

## Disguise Kit

## Расширенное описание Stealth

When a creature tries to hide, it relies on its Dexterity to remain unnoticed. A creature can attempt a Dexterity (Stealth] check to sneak around, moving quietly and using cover and heavily obscured areas to avoid detection.

There are two ways you can hide. If a creature can’t possibly see you, you need only to avoid making noise to avoid detection. If a creature might see you, you need to keep behind cover or stay in heavily obscured areas to remain hidden.

When you try to hide from one or more creatures, your Dexterity (Stealth] check is contested by the Wisdom (Perception] check of any creature who might notice you or the Intelligence (Search] check of a creature that is actively searching for signs of your presence.
You make one Dexterity (Stealth] check for this contest. Use that check result for all such contests you engage in until you are discovered or you stop hiding.

### Conditions for Stealth

In order to avoid detection, you need some way to remain out of sight, either something to hide behind or an area of poor visibility to locate yourself in.

Stay out of sight. You can’t just stand in the middle of an empty, lit room and hope to avoid notice. Something must conceal you, perhaps a large object, a piece of terrain, or an immobile creature of a sufficient size, such as a slumbering dragon. Regardless of what stands between you and a viewer, it must cover at least half your body for you to hide behind it.

An environmental phenomenon that obscures you from view can also provide a means to hide.

A heavily obscured area typically contains darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage. A creature in a heavily obscured area is out of sight, just as it if were hiding behind an obstruction, and thus can try to hide. A lightly obscured area typically contains dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage. Some monsters and characters have special abilities that enable them to try to hide even in areas that are only lightly obscured.

Stay quiet. It's assumed that you try to avoid making noise while hiding, and your Dexterity (Stealth] check also represents your ability to keep quiet. If you make a noise, such as yelling a warning to an ally or knocking over a vase, you give away your position and are thus no longer hidden.

### Benefit of Being Hidden

You have advantage on the attack roll when you attack a creature from which you are hidden. Making an attack reveals your position, however.

## Расширенное описание Perception. Отличие от Investigation

As you move through a dungeon, walk along a forest trail, or search a sage's sanctum, you rely on your abilities to spot hidden clues, notice lurking monsters, find traps or secret doors, and avoid unpleasant surprises. The DM describes the scene to you, but sometimes you want your character to search for something that the DM might be omitting from the description. The perception rules help determine whether your character notices or can find a hidden object or creature.

### Noticing and Finding

Your Wisdom (Perception] check serves as a measure of your general awareness of your surroundings, whether you notice creatures lurking in ambush, hear the stealthy tread of an approaching assassin, or catch the telltale whiff of troglodyte in the air.

Your Intelligence (Investigation] check measures your ability to find something you're looking for, whether it’s the faint outline of a secret door in a wall, the hollow sound that reveals a hidden compartment in the bottom of a chest, clues to a murder, or the footsteps of an invisible creature in the dust.

Sherlock Holmes, renowned for his Intelligence, is the undisputed master of finding clues and determining their significance (using the Investigation skill]. Tarzan, on the other hand, who unfailingly hears the rustle of leaves or the snap of a twig, or sees a stalking tiger or lurking snake, relies on his Wisdom (Perception).

The line between using Wisdom or Intelligence can seem indistinct at times. Making an effort to notice something might seem similar to finding something you’re looking for, but it still relies on Wisdom (Perception], because it’s more about general awareness than it is about attention to detail. Likewise, if you spend a moment to scan the surrounding trees, or press your ear to a door to hear what might lurk beyond, you’re relying on Wisdom (Perception] rather than Intelligence (Investigation]. 

**As a rule, if you’re not positive that Intelligence is the right choice, then Wisdom is the ability to use.**

### Finding a Hidden Object

When your character searches for a hidden object, such as a secret door or a trap, the DM typically asks you to make an Intelligence (Search] check. Such a check can be used to find hidden details or other information and clues that you might otherwise overlook. The DM sets the DC, as usual.

In most cases, you need to tell the DM where you are looking in order for him or her to determine your chance of success. For example, a key is hidden beneath a set of folded clothes in the top drawer of a bureau. If you tell the DM that you pace around the room, looking at the walls and furniture for clues, you have no chance of finding the key, regardless of your Intelligence (Search] check result. You would have to specify that you were opening the drawers or searching the bureau in order to have any chance of success.
Since traps and other dangers might protect hidden objects, this attention to detail is important for the game to remain fair. Just as the DM should never dictate your character’s actions, so too should you make your intentions clear to the DM when you search for concealed clues and hidden treasures.

### Noticing or Finding a Hidden Creature

When a creature is hiding from your character, you contest that creature’s Dexterity (Stealth] check with either a Wisdom (Perception] check

or an Intelligence (Investigation] check. The DM usually asks you for a Wisdom (Perception] check if you have no idea that a creature is present and thus no reason to be actively searching, or if you're taking a moment to scan your surroundings or listen for movement. In this case, your search is a mix of looking and listening, so you don't normally need to be too specific in your description of where you're searching. A lurking foe might give itself away with a muffled cough, a trail of disturbed dust, or some other sign.

The DM generally asks for an Intelligence (Investigation] check if you’re specifically searching for clues to a hidden creature’s location. Here the guidelines for finding a hidden object apply; you need to tell the DM if you’re looking at the curtains for a telltale bulge, checking the floor for footprints, or taking some other action to find the creature.

### Listening at a Door

As your character explores a dungeon or a similar environment, one way to be prepared for dangers ahead is to press your ear to a door in an effort to hear signs of activity beyond. If humanoid creatures are occupying the area, you might hear the casual conversation of bored sentries or a fierce argument between two rival chieftains. If a dragon is sleeping on its treasure pile, you might hear the rhythmic whisper of its breathing, perhaps punctuated by fiery snorts or the crackle of electricity around its nostrils.

When you listen at a door or otherwise try to hear noise in an area, the DM asks you to make a Wisdom (Perception] check, setting the DC based on the volume of whatever you might hear.

## Знания

Использование знаний является опциональным правилом и позволяют более точно описать знания персонажа. В любой момент когда персонаж может выбрать любой навык в инструментах, вместо этого он может выбрать изученные знания, которые позволят добавлять ему к проверкам характеристик бонус proficiency.

# Правила по социальным взаимодействиям - Social Interactions

Exploring dungeons, overcoming obstacles, and slaying monsters are key parts of most D&D adventures, but no less important are the interactions that adventurers have with other people, monsters, and even things in the world. Nonplayer characters might serve as patrons who send the adventurers on quests and reward them for their efforts, as allies who offer them material aid to help them accomplish their goals, as companions who accompany them on their adventures, as obstacles to achieving what they desire, and as adversaries in a social or political arena. Some monsters are open to negotiation when adventurers stumble into their lairs, perhaps granting the heroes their lives in exchange for great piles of treasure or the promise of better food elsewhere. Even dungeon features such as talking statues or magic mirrors can play an important role.

There are several schools of thought when it comes to handling interactions in a roleplaying game. Some players and DMs prefer to speak in character and adopt the mannerisms of their characters in the same way that an actor plays a role on stage. Others prefer to describe a character’s dialogue, giving a basic outline of what the character has to say. Neither approach is necessarily “correct,” and the approach you take has no impact on the rules for resolving interaction situations.

An interaction should always be driven by the back-and-forth between an NPC and the adventurers. No rules are necessary when the adventurers ask an innkeeper for directions or purchase a new coil of rope, and the DM might not even require the characters to play out these routine interactions. Roleplaying is important in important situations, and dice should come into play only when there is uncertainty about a conversation’s outcome. When the adventurers interrogate a captive orc, it might reveal the location of its lair or it might stay silent, even in the face of death. The characters’ words and actions, and their die rolls, help determine the orc’s response.

## Attitudes and Reactions

The starting point for an interaction encounter is the attitude of the NPCs or monsters involved. A creature’s attitude toward the adventurers determines how it acts and how it reacts when they make some request or demand of it.

During the course of an interaction, the adventurers may make requests or demands, and the Dungeon Master may ask for a Charisma check to influence that character. The results of the check are limited by the character’s attitude.

Note that simply rolling badly on a Charisma check does not change the character’s attitude; a low roll (below 10] simply means the adventurer does not convince the character to do something other than its default reaction.

### Friendly

Friendly characters want to help and wish for the adventurers to succeed. These characters are allies, and they trust the characters. A friendly character owes them loyalty, gratitude, or service as a result of their history together. Few characters begin an encounter friendly.

The only reason to make a check when dealing with a friendly character is to see if the character will take personal risks or make sacrifices on behalf of the adventurers. Otherwise, for tasks or actions that require no particular risk, effort, or cost, friendly characters usually help without question.

FRIENDLY NPC REACTIONS

DC      | Result
--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Default | The NPC will do as you wish for requests that don't involve risks or sacrifice
15      | The NPC accepts a minor risk or sacrifice to do as you wish
25      | The NPC accepts a significant risk or sacrifice to do as you wish
 
### Indifferent

Indifferent characters have no special ties to the adventurers. They might help or hinder the adventurers, depending on what benefits them the most. The vast majority of NPCs in normal situations begin an encounter indifferent.

Note that a character’s indifference does not mean the person is standoffish or uninterested. Indifferent characters might be polite, genial, surly, irritable, or anywhere in between. Being indifferent simply means the NPC does not actively work against the adventurers, nor have they yet earned the NPC’s support as an ally.

A check is usually necessary when the adventurers try to persuade an indifferent character to do something.

INDIFFERENT NPC REACTIONS

DC      | Result
--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------
Default | The NPC offers no help or harm
15      | The NPC will do as you wish without taking risks or making sacrifices
25      | The NPC accepts a minor risk or sacrifice to do as you wish

### Hostile

Hostile characters oppose the adventurers and their goals. They are enemies, and they actively work to see the adventurers fail. They often take actions to harm or stymie the adventurers.

However, a character’s hostility doesn’t mean that the character will attack on sight. For example, a condescending noble might wish to see a group of upstart adventurers fail in order to keep them from rivaling him for the king’s attention; in this case, the noble might be hostile toward the adventurers, but would choose slander and scheming over direct, physical violence as a means of thwarting their efforts.

Adventurers almost always need to make a fairly challenging Charisma check to convince a hostile creature to do anything on their behalf.

HOSTILE NPC REACTIONS

DC      | Result
--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Default | The NPC opposes your actions and may take risks to do so
15      | The NPC offers no help or harm
25      | The NPC will help you as long as there are no risks or sacrifices involved

## Changing Attitudes	

Character attitudes are not set in stone, and the attitude of a character interacting with the party might change over the course of a conversation. Attitudes are fluid, and sometimes shift (either temporarily, or permanently] based on ongoing interactions.

Permanently changing a character’s attitude requires a significant effort. It’s impossible to completely change an attitude over the course of a brief conversation, but it can change over time. A character’s attitude changes in response to actions, not words. If a character offers help to the adventurers, who then abuse that offer, the character might become hostile. Likewise, a hostile character who profits from the party’s actions can become indifferent or even friendly. After any interaction, the Dungeon Master can change the character’s attitude for the purposes of his or her next interaction with the party if the long-term results of the interaction harmed or benefited the character.

Temporarily changing a character’s attitude, however, is somewhat easier and can have a significant effect on the outcome of an interaction. If the adventurers say or do the right things during an interaction, they can make a hostile character temporarily indifferent, or an indifferent character temporarily friendly. Likewise, a gaffe, insult or harmful deed might make a friendly character temporarily indifferent, or an indifferent character hostile.

Typically, you cannot shift a character’s attitude (either temporarily, or permanently] more than one step during a single interaction.

## Ideals, Flaws, and Bonds

All characters have character traits known as ideals, flaws, and bonds, which can be used during an interaction to temporarily change a character’s attitude. Touching positively on a character’s ideals, flaws, or bonds during an interaction can shift the character’s attitude in a positive direction, and vice versa.

Ideals motivate the character to act in a certain way. This encompasses everything from the character’s life goal to a core belief system.

Ideals might answer any of these questions: What are the principles that this character will never betray? What would prompt this character to make sacrifices? What drives this character to act and guides its goals and ambitions? What is the single most important thing this character strives for?

Flaws represent the vices, compulsions, fears, and weaknesses of a character.

Flaws might answer any of these questions: What enrages the character? What is the one thing that he or she cannot bear to witness without becoming angry? What is the character afraid of? What’s the one person, concept, or event that he or she is terrified of? What are the character’s vices?

Bonds represent the character’s connection to people, places, and events in the world.

Bonds might answer any of these questions: Whom does the character care most about? To where does the character feel a special connection? What is the character’s most treasured possession?

Whenever a request or statement in an interaction touches on a character’s ideals, flaws, or bonds, it might have a positive or negative impact on the character’s reaction, making it easier or harder to persuade the character to act. Here are some examples:

*	A druid’s ideals include protecting the forest. Asking the druid to help burn down the forest betrays this ideal and would shift the druid’s reaction toward hostility.
*	The head of the Thieves’ Guild holds ideals involving profit and larceny. Asking the guildmaster for help in pulling off a heist plays into this ideal and might get a more positive response.
*	A barbarian chieftain’s flaw might be a fear of being perceived as weak. Trying to persuade him to back down from a fight would play right into that fear, shifting his attitude toward hostility.
*	A farmer’s flaw might be an overwhelming fear of orcs raiding his farm. Persuading him to flee his home is much easier if the characters can play off that fear.
*	A noble’s bonds might include his love for his dearest daughter. Asking him to put her at risk for any reason threatens that bond and shifts his attitude toward hostility.
*	A paladin’s bonds might include his fondness for his home village. Asking him to help defend the village from attack is a relatively easy task.

## Learning a Character's Traits

If the adventurers can learn another character’s ideals, flaws, or bonds before or during an interaction, they can gain a significant advantage compared to stumbling blindly through the interaction. Knowing a character’s traits allows them to avoid the pitfalls associated with negatively provoking the character and might allow them to present their requests in the most favorable way.

After interacting with another character for at least 10 minutes, feeling out the subject's personality and traits through conversation, a character can attempt a Wisdom (Insight] check to uncover one of the character’s ideals, flaws, or bonds. The player declares what type of trait (ideal, flaw, or bond] he or she wants to uncover, and the DC is based on the subject’s Wisdom score.

Characters with a higher Wisdom are more in control of themselves and better able to mask their inner concerns.

Increase the DC by up to 10 if the character consciously tries to hide a trait. If the adventurer’s check fails by 10 or more, the player character might misidentify a trait. The DM might provide a false trait or invert one of the character’s existing traits. For example, if an old sage’s flaw is that he is prejudiced against the uneducated, the inverse would indicate that the sage enjoys personally seeing to the education of the downtrodden.

## Resolving the Interaction

After making sure that every character has had the opportunity to engage in the interaction to the extent he or she desires, and that the players have had time to discover all that they want to know about a character’s ideals, flaws, and bonds, the DM can call for a Charisma check. (Depending on the approach the characters take, the Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion skills might apply.] This Charisma check signals the climactic moment of the interaction, which sets the subject’s course of action with its outcome.
Other characters participating in an interaction can influence it, for better or worse.

If a helping character says or does something that would influence the interaction in a positive way, the character making the Charisma check can do so with advantage. On the other hand, if a “helping” character says something stupid or offensive, the character making the Charisma check has disadvantage on that check.

Once the check has been made, further attempts are usually fruitless, at least for the time being. If the players try to press the issue once the check has been made and resolved, they run the risk of upsetting or angering the subject, potentially shifting his or her attitude toward hostility.

## Intelligent Creatures

Intelligent creatures are creatures that have a value of Intelligence of 6 or more. If such a creature is used as a mount, it acts independetly and can also attack as one of it's actions, as stated in the official rules. Intelligent creatures are independent creatures. Indeed there can be communication between the creature and it's master, however the creatures acts independently and thus have a turn of their own. This applies to also to riden mounts. These creatures are controlled by the DM.

NOTE: The only exception for this rule is the mount from the **Find Steed** spell. Due to the nature of the spell, that mount is controlled by the PC. Whether intelligent or not, each creature is still a beast at heart. It might disagree with the rider going in a certain direction such as jumping great heights. The DM might ask the PC to make a particular check whether to remain mounted or maybe the creature just runs off.

Intelligent creatures might challenge their master more then non-intelligent creatures, especially when the mount is being asked to do something that might hard for it, it considers dangerous or maybe something that it fears.

## Death of a Mount or Companion

Mounts roll for death saves. A dead mount can be resurrected if the requirements for a ressuraction spell are met. This applies also the companion creatures. Potions Potions and other consumables work as intended even on mounts. But so do the harmful effects of negative potions and poisons.

## Companion Needs

Just like a normal PC, mounts and pets have basic needs. They need: Food and Water to survive Rest after a long day To breathe Someone to take care of them Food and Water is either brought along before the adventure started or else it can be scavanged while in session. Most of the time it will be easy for the mount to be sustained while on an adventure, however some enviroments \(such as deserts or frozen landscapes\) will make it very hard and might possibly starve your mount. Normal exhaustion rules apply if a mount is not sustained.

Food and Water Needs

| Creature Size | Food per Day | Water per Day |
|---------------|--------------|---------------|
| Tiny          | 1/4 pound    | 1/4 gallon    |
| Small         | 1 pound      | 1 gallon      |
| Medium        | 1 pound      | 1 gallon      |
| Large         | 4 pounds     | 4 gallons     |
| Huge          | 16 pounds    | 16 gallons    |
| Gargantuan    | 64 pounds    | 64 gallons    |

## Official Ruling from the D&D Player's Handbook 5e

```text
Resting after a long day is a big must if you want your mount to remain healthy. They will suffer normal exhaustion effects if they fail to rest or are being pushed over the limit. Breathing is a rather obvious need. Depending on the nature of the mount, different mounts can breathe in different enviroments and cannot in others. Sometime a PCs has to leave his mount behind if the mount cannot breathe in a certain enviroment he wants to explore. This takes us to the following need. Someone to take care of the mount is needed, especially if the mount is not Intelligent. As discussed before, most of the time the PC has to provide nurishment for his mount. If in danger, the PC needs to protect his mount. Most mounts cannot really fend of for themselves but are a very valuable asset when guided by someone. All of the above applies also for companion creatures. In town, adventurer owned mounts and beasts can be left at the stables were all their needs will be looked after. Stables are discussed in the next chapter.
```

## Riding a mount with no saddle

No saddle while mounting means that both the beast and the rider and uncomforable. The rider does not have anything that supports him on his mount. Any check done by the PC to remain mounted is done at a disadvantage. Any attack preformed by the PC will be at a disadvantage. While in combat, the rider has to perform a check to remain mounted if the mount moves and the rider does any other action other then try keep steady

## Combat Mechanics

In this section we are going to discuss the combat mechanics of a mounted PC and his mount.

### Mount Actions in Combat

A non-intelligent mount can take three different types of actions in combat, while an intelligent one can also take any other actions from its statblock.

#### Dash

A mount can take this action to move twice his normal movement speed.

#### Disengage

When disengaging a mount can move without triggering attacks of opportunity. \(Homebrew\) The rider will still provoke an attack of opportunity.\*

#### Dodge

The mount can take the dodge action as normal PC or NPCs can. However, only creatures attacking the mount itself will get disadvantage on attack rolls and only the mount will get advantage on Dexterity saving throws. The rider is not affected.

### Area of Effect on Mounted Creatures

When a mounted PC and his mount are inside the Area of Effect of a spell or effect, the rider can be affected too. If HALF the squares that make up the mount's token are inside the are of effect, and that effect affects in a 3D spectrum \(not only the ground\), then both rider and mount are effected.

### Ranged Attacks while Mounted

Riders doing ranged attacks while mounted will have disadvantage on the attack roll. This also applies to both ranged weapon attacks and ranged spell attacks.

### Animal Handling

Animal handling is a vital skill when it comes to mounts. A rider needs to be good with animals if it wants to ride one. If a character does not have proficiency in Animal Handling, all rolls related to keeping control of the mount and related will be at a flat DISADVANTAGE, no matter all the other roll modifiers. You still get the +/- modifier related to Animal Handling.

Note: A mount summoned by Find STEED does not require proficiency in animal handling since the nature of the spell.

### Keeping Control of the Mount

At the start of every turn, a mounted creature has to succeed a DC 10 Animal Handling check. This check is straight forward. If the character has proficiency in Animal Handling then he rolls with advantage. If the character does not have Animal Handling, he rolls with disadvantage. If he fails the Animal Handling check then he must succeed DC 10 Dexterity saving throw \(modifiers from saddle's apply\) otherwise he will be knocked prone 5ft away from the mount and take 1d6 bludgeoning damage. The mount will dash as far as possible away from it's rider. That will be the end of the rider's turn. If the rider succeeds the Dexterity saving throw, he will land on his feet 5ft next to the mount. He will still have his turn, but the mount will still be spooked off.

## Melee Reach

Mounted combat adds a 3 Dimenstional element to combat. Every creature has his own height. If you ride on top of a creature, you are standing on that creauture's back, hench elevated from the ground by that creature's height. Each mount has a height value stated in it's character sheet. That value is the distance the rider is standing above the ground when riding the said mount.

Mounted character melee weapon without "REACH" attribute:

Mount Size Cannot hit

Medium - None

Large - Tiny or smaller

Huge - Medium or smaller

Gargantum - Large or smaller

Mounted character melee weapon with "REACH" attribute:

Mount Size Cannot hit

Medium - None

Large - None

Huge - Medium or smaller

Gargantum - Large or smaller

**Note:** These melee range restrictions also apply when a creature of the stated size wants to attack the rider who is standing on a mount.

For example a medium or smaller sized creature, wielding a melee weapon without the 'Reach' attribute, cannot hit the rider of a Huge or bigger mount.

## Armor Description

**Armor spikes.** Armor spikes can be added to a set of medium or heavy armor for 150 gp, representing the price of the spikes and the expertise needed to add them to a set of armor.

While wearing armor with spikes, wrestling with you is a dangerous proposition. If you use the Attack action to grapple a creature within 5 feet of you and successfully do so, the creature takes 1d4 piercing damage. If the creature ends its turn being grappled by you in this way and is within 5 feet of you, it takes another 1d4 piercing damage. If the suit of armor is magical, the damage dealt by the spikes is also considered magical.


**Banded**. This armor is made of overlapping strips of metal sewn to a backing of leather and chain mail. The strips cover vulnerable areas; the chain mail and leather protect the joints while providing freedom of movement. Straps and buckles distribute the weight evenly, making it easier to move around in this armor. This suit includes a helmet and gauntlets.

**Dragon Leather.** This leather armor is made from the hide of a dragon. It is extremely supple yet far more durable than standard leather armor.
 
**Dragon Scale.** This suit of scale mail is made from a dragon’s scales rather than metal, granting it superior protective capabilities and flexibility.

**Mithral Plate.** This suit of plate is crafted from mithral. It is easy to move in compared to other sorts of metal armor. The dwarves sometimes gift this armor to their most trusted allies.

**Mithral Shirt.** This extremely light chain mail shirt is made of very fine mithral links. The armor is light enough to wear under normal clothing. It is most commonly crafted by elves.

**Armored Coat** Consisting of a short leather jacket reinforced with hidden metal plates, the protective natur of these jackets can be overlooked. Traditionally, they are fitted with hidden pockets and wrist scabbards that can hold a dagger or other small weapon.

This armor can be easily mistaken for normal clothing; any observer must succeed in a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check to recognize the true nature of the armor

**Buckler**: This small shield is fitted around the arm and made of metal, wood, or boiled leather. It takes the same time to don and doff as a normal shield \(1 action\) and a character cannot benefit from a buckler and any other type of shield at the same time. Unlike a shield, a character can still use the hand in which the buckler is equipped. If during a character's turn they use an item with this hand, attack with a weapon in this hand, or attack with a two-handed weapon, then the character does not gain the buckler's bonus to AC until the start of their next turn. Attacking with a one-handed weapon or thrown weapon using the buckler hand causes disadvantage on the attack roll. The hand wielding the buckler does not count as a free hand for the purposes of spellcasting, grappling, or unarmed attacks. A character proficient with shields is also considered proficient with bucklers. A buckler does not benefit from the rules or abilities that specifically refer to shields, such as the Protection Fighting Style or the Shield Master feat.

Targe. This shield is wielded in a way that leaves one’s hand open. While wearing a targe, your Armor Class increases by 1. You can use the hand you wield the targe in to manipulate objects, shove, grapple, or perform somatic spell components.
Creatures that are proficient with regular shields are proficient with targes.




**Tower Shield:** A huge metal-reinforced shield nearly as tall as its wielder. Donning and doffing the tower shield takes 1 action. A character cannot benefit from a tower shield and any other type of shield at the same time. While a tower shield is equipped, its bearer takes disadvantage on all attack rolls due to the off-balancing encumbrance of the shield, unless the weapon has the Light property. A character proficient with both shields and heavy armor is assumed to be proficient with tower shields. All other rules that affect shields still apply to tower shields. Tower shield. While wielding a tower shield, your Armor Class increases by 3, but your speed decreases by 5 feet and you have disadvantage on Dexterity checks and saving throws. You provide three-quarters cover, instead of half cover, to other creatures. You can use your action to set the shield like a wall, giving yourself total cover against ranged attacks until the start of your next turn. Creatures that are proficient with heavy armor are proficient with tower shields.

**Spiked shield:** While wielding a spiked shield, your Armor Class increases by 1. A spiked shield serves as a **martial melee weapon** that deals 1d4 piercing damage. You can use spiked shield as off-hand weapon using standard[2] rules for two-weapon fighting. Characters that are proficient with regular shields are proficient with spiked shields,both as a shield and a weapon.

### Special Weapons

Weapons with special rules are described here.

**Bolas.** A Large or smaller creature hit by a bolas must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or be restrained by it. A creature can break free of the bolas by using its action to make a DC 10 Strength check or by dealing 5 slashing damage to the bolas. Formless creatures are immune to this effect.

**Net.** When you attack with a net, you target a point in space. Each Large or smaller creature within 5 feet of that point must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or be restrained by the net. A creature can break free of the net by using its action to make a DC 10 Strength check or by dealing 5 slashing damage to the net.

**Boomerang.** When you throw this weapon and miss, it returns to your hand. Creatures that are proficient with javelins are also proficient with boomerangs.

**Composite bow.** These bows use a complex design with a high draw weight. You add your Strength modifier alongside your Dexterity modifier to damage rolls for composite bows.

Garrote. When you attack with this weapon and hit, you immediately grapple the target if it is Large or smaller and is not formless. This grapple ends early if you let go of either end of the garrote. While grappled in this way, the creature is gagged, cannot breathe, and melee attacks against it are made with advantage. Rogues are proficient with garrotes.

Kusarigama. This double weapon has very different ends, attached by a chain: a sickle, dealing slashing damage; and a weight, dealing bludgeoning damage with the reach property. You can choose which end with which to attack. Monks are proficient with the kusarigama and can treat it as a monk weapon.

Parrying dagger. When you wield this weapon and are targeted by a melee weapon attack, you can use your reaction to increase your AC by 2 against that attack. Rogues are proficient with parrying daggers.

Repeating crossbows. These crossbows are fitted with cartridges that can hold up to six crossbow bolts. A repeating crossbow automatically reloads after firing until it runs out of ammunition. You can reload the cartridge as an action.

### New Weapon Properties

**Penetrating:** Some ranged weapons are particularly effective against armored opponents at close range. Weapons with the penetrating property grant advantage on attack rolls when used against armored opponents within 15 feet. This ability is ineffective against abilities that increase AC but are not armor such as the monk’s Unarmored Defense.

**Versatile Damage:** Weapons with this quality have both a primary and a secondary damage type. Your weapon will always do the primary damage type unless you declare otherwise before you roll damage.

**Worn:** Worn weapons augment your unarmed attack damage and may not be disarmed. Putting on or removing a worn weapon takes an action.

**Double**:

Double. A double weapon has two ends with which you can attack. When you take the Attack action and attack with the weapon, you can engage in two-weapon fighting with it, treating one end as the required light weapon with the specified damage die.


### New and changed weapons


**Drow War Gauntlet** Created by the dark elves, this wicked implement looks like a leather glove covered with odd protrusions. When a hidden catch is pressed (effectively equivalent to drawing a weapon), twisted blades and spikes spring forth. When you press the catch, you can choose whether you want to deal slashing or piercing damage. The gauntlet continues to deal the type of damage you have chosen until you press the catch to retract the blades. You can’t be disarmed of this weapon by normal means, but when you press the catch and the blades spring forth, you can’t hold anything in the hand upon which you are wearing the gauntlet.

**Two-handed Morningstar** This weapon is simply a larger and heavier version of the standard Morningstar. It is often carried for purposes of sheer intimidation, as it looks wicked indeed.

**Blastpowder and shot (10)** 25 gp per weapon 2 lbs. per weapon

**Cestus:** Popular in the arenas and tavernas of Coryan, this reinforced leather glove consists of a series of leather thongs that are tied over the hand; the thongs secure a set of metal plates, one over the knuckles and the other along the back of the hand. There are two variants of this weapon. The myrmex "limb-piercer" has the versatile damage (piercing) property and the sphairai "bone-breaker" has the versatile damage (slashing) property.

*** On a hit with this weapon, the wielder can forgo dealing damage and attempt to trip the target, in which case the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or fall prone. The DC is 8 + the wielder's Strength modifier + the wielder's proficiency bonus.

**** This weapon is similar to a light crossbow except that it has half the range (40/160 feet) and doesn't have the loading property. It automatically reloads after firing until it runs out of ammunition. Reloading the cartridge takes an action.

***** Can't be bought by player characters. 

### About Worn Weapons

```
You can use weapons you wear on your body, (worn weapons), to make unarmed strikes. When you make an unarmed strike while wearing a worn weapon, you deal the weapon’s damage instead of your normal unarmed strike damage. You must able to use the part of your body where the weapon is attached to make the unarmed strike. You cannot use a cestus to make an unarmed strike if you are using that hand to wield a sword or hold a lantern. For example, when you attack with a cestus, your unarmed strike deals 1d4 + your Strength modifier bludgeoning damage, assuming you use the fist wearing the cestus to make that unarmed strike. 

Worn weapons do allow you to benefit from runes and other magical effects that can be applied to weapons.Any rune or spell that would affect a weapon can be applied to a worn weapon, and the rune or effect applies to your unarmed strikes.

```

**Flintlocks:** Altheria may be a center of knowledge and learning, but it is the power of blastpowder that has kept the Republic of Altheria safe for many years. The Altherians’ advanced understanding of blastpowder and its explosive potential has aided them in the design of their flintlock weapons. 

Altherian flintlocks are designed to take advantage of specific amounts of blastpowder for every shot, leading to the creation of blastpowder rounds – small paper or cloth packets of blastpowder pre-measured to gain the most efficient and accurate shot. Therefore, these fine weapons are usually easier, safer, and faster to reload and fire.

Altherians, as well as clerics and holy champions of Althares, may purchase flintlocks at the listed price and may carry them regardless of rank.

You do not suffer penalties for firing a flintlock while prone. Unless you have a flintlock maintenance kit and are proficient with it, whenever you roll a 1 on a ranged attack roll with a flintlock the weapon malfunctions and jams. A jammed flintlock cannot be fired. 

Repairing a jammed flintlock requires proficient use of a flintlock maintenance kit and takes 10 minutes.

Additionally, in Arcanis flintlocks are reinforced and balanced for use as improvised melee weapons. Flintlock pistols may be used as clubs, while flintlock rifles may be used as greatclubs. If you are proficient with a club or greatclub, you can add your proficiency bonus to attack rolls with your flintlock when you use it as an improvised weapon.

**Arrow, Barbed.** This piece of ammunition causes bleeding wounds. A creature hit with a barbed arrow or bolt takes 1 point of piercing damage at the beginning of its turn until it uses its action to pull the arrow free. Once pulled free of the wound, the ammunition is destroyed.

**Arrow, Smoldering.** This piece of ammunition has a hollow point containing alchemist’s fire and a simple ignition mechanism. A creature you hit with a smoldering arrow or bolt takes 1d4 fire damage at the beginning of its next turn. Once ignited, the ammunition is destroyed.

**Arrow, Smoking.** This piece of ammunition lets out a blast of smoke on contact. A 5-foot radius sphere centered on the creature or point you hit is heavily obscured until the end of your next turn. Once ignited, the ammunition is destroyed.
**Arrow, Splintering.** When you hit a creature with a splintering arrow or bolt, it explodes into wooden or bone shards. Each creature within 5 feet of the target must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 piercing damage. Once it explodes, the ammunition is destroyed.
Smoke pellet. As an action or bonus action, you can throw a smoke pellet at a point within 10 feet of you. The smoke pellet then detonates and is destroyed, creating a 10-foot cube filled with smoke. This area is heavily obscured until the end of your next turn.
**Smokestick.** As an action, you can ignite a smokestick using a torch, tinderbox, or other source of fire or intense heat. Once ignited, the smokestick continually fills the area within 5 f eet of it with thick, black smoke. An area filled with the smoke is heavily obscured. This smoke disperses at the end of your next turn, but the smokestick continues to burn for 1 minute, allowing it to be thrown or moved around with to form large areas of smoke.
**Tanglefoot bag.** As an action, you can throw this bag of alchemic goo at a creature within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged attack against a creature, treating the bag as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the creature is restrained for 1 minute if it is Large or smaller. Hit or miss, the tanglefoot bag is then destroyed. A creature restrained by the goo can free itself by using its action to make a DC 13 Strength check or by dealing 10 points of slashing damage to the goo. The goo has an AC of 13. In either case, the effect ends early.
**Thunderstone.** As an action, you can throw a thunderstone up to 30 feet. When it strikes a hard surface or is struck hard, it creates a deafening bang and is destroyed. Creatures within 10 feet of the stone must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be deafened for 1 hour. If a creature deafened in this way casts a spell with verbal components, it must make a DC 11 Charisma saving throw or fail to cast the spell.
**Tindertwig.** You can strike the end of this small, wooden stick on a flammable object, requiring no action. The object immediately ignites and the tindertwig is destroyed.

**Acid.** A glass vial of acid holds 4 ounces. As an action, you can splash the contents of the vial onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw the vial up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a target creature or object. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 acid damage. If poured on metal, the metal takes 1d4 acid damage at the start of each of your turns for 1d4 rounds.

**Adventurer's Kit.** This pack has the basics that an adventurer needs to get along in the wilderness. The kit includes a backpack loaded with a healer's kit, a mess kit, a tinderbox, ten torches, ten days of rations, and a waterskin. In addition, 50 feet of hempen rope are strapped to the pack.

**Alchemist's Fire.** This sticky, adhesive fluid ignites when exposed to air. A clay flask of alchemist's fire contains 1 pint. As an action, you can throw the flask up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a target creature or object. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 11 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.

**Holy Water.** A clay flask of holy water contains 1 pint. As an action, you can splash the contents of the flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a target creature. On a hit against a fiend or evil undead creature, the target takes 1d4 radiant damage.
Horse. A typical riding horse can carry one rider and most of the typical adventurer’s supplies at a speed of 60 feet. If you have proficiency with land mounts, you can add your proficiency bonus to ability checks you make to control a horse under difficult circumstances.

**Thieves' Tools.** This set of tools includes a small file, a set of lock picks, a small mirror mounted on a metal handle, a set of narrow- bladed scissors, and a pair of pliers. Proficiency with thieves’ tools allows you to use them to attempt the following tasks.

***Disable a Trap:*** You can use your action to make a Dexterity check to attempt to disable a trap, applying your proficiency bonus to the check. You must have physical access to the trap’s mechanisms. If you succeed, you disable the trap and can bypass it safely. If you fail your Dexterity check by 5 or more, you trigger the trap.

***Open a Lock:*** You can use your action to make a Dexterity check to attempt to open a lock, applying your proficiency bonus to the check. If you succeed, you open the lock.

**Tinderbox.** This small container holds flint, firesteel, and tinder (usually dry cloth soaked in light oil] used to kindle a fire. Lighting a torch with the flint and steel takes an action, and lighting any other fire takes at least that long.

Falconry Kit. In this bag is a single leather bracer, a leather cowl, a whistle, a set of small bells, and leather strips.
A Wisdom Check may come when training a small bird of prey, where as a Charism check might be useful when taming the bird
Farming Tools. In this bag is a collapsible hoe, a collapsible rake, a book of known herbs and their farming techniques, and a small satchel of seeds worth 3 gp.
If a character wishes to tend to their own garden or plant seeds, it would be appropriate to ask for a Wisdom check, where as tiying to identify a plant with their book may use an Intelligence check. If a character would try to gather leaves in a pile quickly, it wouldn't be uncommon to ask for a Dexterity check, while trying to clear thick roots might be a Strength check.
Prospector's Kit. In this metal box is a collapsible hammer used to breaking small rocks, a gold pan, a tiny magnifying glass, a handful of brushes, and a scraping tool.
It would be common to ask for a Dexterity check when trying to properly scrap clay or rock off of a surface, whereas it might be suitable for a Wisdom check to pick out the fine flakes of gold An Intelligence check might be called for identifying the difference between silver and Sham Silver.
Taxidermist's Kit. This container holds a set of leather punches, a fine knife for scraping, a pair of small shears, and needles.
A Strength check would be suitable for attempting to gather the tough scales of a dragon, where as a Dexterity check might be more preferable for softer hides. A Charisma check might be asked in order to make a beautiful taxidermized creature for a patron.


Parachute. This parachute is more of a small glider, rather than a widespread cloth. The frame is made of a sturdy metal, which has loops that hold the fabric. The parachute takes 1 minute to unfold and set up. A creature can use this to move at a rate of their long jump speed per round when in the air, while descending at a slowed rate of 30 feet per round
Spice Rack. A small assortment of spices and containers are stored in a wooden box. Using a spice rack allows food past its prime to be consumed without ill effects. If the spice rack is used for cooking food during a short rest, a character regains 1 additional hit point for every hit die they expend 



## New Equipment Packs

**Soldier’s Pack (14 gp):** 

Includes a backpack, a bedroll, a hammer, a mess-kit, 10 pitons, 10 torches, a tinderbox, a tent, 10 days of rations, and a waterskin. The pack also has 50 feet of hempen rope strapped to the side of it. 

### Optional Rule: Large Weapons and Armor

```

There are some Heroes who are naturally Large size, or who have the ability to increase their size and become Large.

If this occurs, you may be required to purchase weapons and armor sized for a Large creature.

Finding someone with the skill to forge Large-sized equipment is no easy task, and the equipment itself costs double its listed price. Large weapons deal an extra die of damage, so a Large longsword deals 2d8 damage. You cannot wear armor that is too small for you.

If you try to wield a weapon too big for you, you suffer disadvantage on all attack rolls with that weapon, even if you are proficient with it. If you wear armor that is too big for you, you suffer disadvantage on all Dexterity (Stealth) checks and your speed is reduced by 10, no matter your Strength.

```

# Beyond Damage Dice

## SWORDS

### GREATSWORD

**Arcing Slash.** When you attack with a greatsword, **once per turn** you may choose to target two creatures within your reach with a single attack. This attack uses the same attack roll for both targets and deals slashing damage equal to id6 plus your Strength modifier to each target. 

**Grinding Halt.** Whenever you must make a Strength saving throw to avoid being moved against your will, you can dig the blade of your greatsword into the ground as a reaction. Roll 2d6 and add the number rolled to the saving throw. If the effect pushing you does not have a saving throw, you move 5 feet fewer.

### LONGSWORD

**Lock Blades.** When a creature attacks you with a weapon, you may use your reaction to attempt to lock blades and parry their attack. Make an attack roll with your longsword. You have advantage on this roll if you are wielding your lpngsword with two hands. If the result of this roll equals or exceeds their attack roll, their attack misses. 

**Short Draw.** As an attack, you may draw a sheathed one-handed sword and make an attack roll to strike the enemy with its pommel, leaving the target gasping for breath. This attack deals no damage, but the next attack roll made against the target has advantage. You must have at least one hand free to take this action.

### RAPIER

**Main Gauche.**^Thle wielding both a rapier and a dagger, you may use a reaction after being attacked to roll a d4 and add the result to your Armor Class until the end of the attacker’s turn. 

**Lock Blades.** When a creature attacks you with a weapon, you may use your reaction to make an attack roll with your rapier. If the result of this roll equals or exceeds their attack roll, their attack misses. ■

### SCIMITAR

**Bloody Wound.** When you hit a living creature with a scimitar, you can choose to make a superficial but bloody wound. The attack deals no damage, but the target takes id6 slashing damage at the beginning of each of its turns until it makes a DC 10 Wisdom \(Medicine\) check as an action to stop the bleeding or until it receives magical healing. A creature can have only one bloody wound at a time. 

**Short Draw.** As an attack, you may draw a sheathed one-handed sword and make an attack roll to strike the enemy with its pommel, leaving the target gasping for breath. This attack deals no damage, but the next attack roll made against the target has advantage. You must have at least one hand free to take this action.

### SHORTSWORD

**Close Quarters Combat.** When you successfully grapple a creature or escape a grapple, you may make a single \_ attack with a short sword as a bonus action. Additionally, whenever a creature fails to escape a grapple with you, you may make a single attack with a short sword as a reaction. 

**Short Draw.** As an attack, you may draw a sheathed one-handed sword and make an attack roll to strike the enemy with its pommel, leaving the target gasping for breath. This attack deals no damage, but the next attack roll made against the target has advantage. You must have at least one hand free to take this action.

## POLEARMS AND AXES

### BATTLEAXE

**Crushing Blow.** As an action, you can make a single attack roll with your battleaxe against an armored or naturally armored creature within 5 feet of you. If the attack hits, the target’s AC is permanently reduced by 1 until its armor is repaired, but cannot be reduced below 10 + the target’s Dexterity modifier. This attack has no effect on creatures with magical armor, unless your battleaxe is also magical.

### GLAIVE

**Disarming Parry.** When a creature attacks you with a **melee** weapon, you may use your reaction to catch their weapon in your glaive’s hook and disarm them. Make an attack roll with your glaive. If the result of this roll equals or exceeds their attack roll, their attack misses and they must succeed on a Strength saving throw or drop their weapon. 

**Trip.** As an attack while you are wielding a glaive, you may sweep your opponent’s legs in an attempt to trip them. Make an attack roll against a Large or smaller creature. If the attack hits, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or fall prone.

### NET

Nets have the unique property, **Ensnaring**, described below.

> **Ensnaring:** A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger.

### NORDMANSCH GREATAXE

The nordmansch greataxe likely originated with the foresters and lumberjacks of the Ordenn forest, who found a way of making axe heads they continue to keep secret. The nordmansch make more axes than their woodsmen actually need. The nordmansch greataxe is a two-handed weapon built to sunder other weapons. Its edge is hardened especially for this purpose, and its haft is likewise set with trapping prongs to catch and hold a foe’s weapon. At the GM’s discretion, typical greataxes may also use the sundering strike maneuver. 

**Sundering Strike.** As part of the attack action, make a single attack roll with your nordmansch against a creature wielding a weapon, including natural weapons. If the attack hits, the weapon is damaged, and all attacks made with this weapon have disadvantage. Another sundering strike destroys the weapon.

### NORTHLANDS ESTOC

A hand-and-a-half sword designed to pierce heavy armor and sharpened only on the tip, an estoc is 4 feet long, sometimes with a second crossguard. It is said to have been used first by the knights ofVaelTurog and Balinor against the elves, but now is used by dwarven mercenaries and human knights who expect to fight other heavily armored warriors. Its anti-armor properties make it popular with monster hunters and dragon slayers as well. Sometimes called the “tuck.” The estoc also has the following special property. Special: The estoc deals an additional id6 damage to creatures wearing heavy armor, or naturally armored creatures with an AC of 16 or higher. 

**Armor-Piercing Thrust.** As an action, you may pinpoint a weak point of an opponent’s armor and make a single attack with your estoc against it. This attack pierces armor, treating the target’s AC as io + their Dexterity modifier. On a hit, this attack does normal weapon damage, and does not deal the additional damage granted by the estoc’s special property \(above\). 

**Blunted Bash**. Instead of dealing piercing damage, you can choose to deal bludgeoning damage by striking the target with the estoc’s unsharpened blade. This attack’s damage die is one size smaller than normal \(id4 if one-handed, id6 if two-handed\), and cannot benefit from the estoc’s special property \(below\).

### ROTHENIAN PONIARD

This longsword has a spring-loaded poniard concealed in the hilt, which quickly extends when the hilt is gripped in a particular way. It is particularly beloved by rogues, as the concealed blade helps them sneak attack opponents already locked in combat. Kariv of a crueler bent have been known to poison the secondary blade. Thanks to its hidden blade, the Rothenian poniard has the following special ability: 

> **Special:** The larger blade is a versatile weapon, and the secondary blade is a light weapon. You may make an attack with the secondary blade as bonus action, as if you were two-weapon fighting. Retracting the poniard requires an action.

**Hidden Poniard.** If the poniard is still concealed within your sword’s hilt, you may make a Dexterity \(Sleight of Hand\) check opposed by a target creature’s Wisdom \(Perception\) check. If you win this contest, you may make a single attack roll with the concealed poniard against that target. This attack has advantage. 

## SOUTHLANDS WEAPONS

### DIKAMA \(FANG BLADE\)

First crafted by the bronzesmiths of the Lion Kingdom of Omphaya, the wicked dikama fang blade is shaped like a serrated, oversized lion’s tooth. 

**Bloody Wound.** When you hit a living creature with a dikama, you can choose to make a superficial but bloody wound. The attack deals no damage, but the target takes id6 slashing damage at the beginning of each of its turns until it or another creature makes a DC 10 Wisdom \(Medicine\) check as an action to stop the bleeding or until it receives magical healing. 

**Serrated Twist.** When you deal damage to a living creature with a dikama \(not including damage from the Bloody Wound maneuver\), you may twist the serrated blade as a bonus action. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw or take 2d4 slashing damage.

Armor: A suit of scale or plate made from fervidite may look dull, but it is much lighter than a similar suit made of a different metal. Fervidite armor removes disadvantage of Dexterity (Stealth) checks and any Strength requirement to move at full speed caused by the armor. Additionally,

Medium fervidite armor can be worn under clothing, requiring an observer to succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check to spot the armor.

Weapon: Weapons and ammunition made from fervidite have 50 extra hit points and are considered to be  both adamantine and silver for the purpose of bypassing damage resistances and immunities, or triggering damage vulnerabilities. Fervidite can be used to either forge the blade of a weapon like a sword or it can be used to add studs and tracings to a weapon like a quarterstaff.

Due to the strength of the metal, ammunition made from fervidite generally does not break when fired. At the end of combat, you can recover all expended ammunition made from fervidite, unless the GM says otherwise. 



Armor: While you are wearing a suit of adamantine armor, anytime you are hit with a critical strike the attack becomes a normal hit and the armor takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to AC. Adamantine armor reduced to AC 10 is destroyed. Some smiths can repair adamantine armor, but the process is expensive and time consuming. Usually, it costs half the total purchase cost to repair adamantine armor.

Weapon: Weapons made of adamantine are virtually unbreakable and have resistance to all slashing, piercing, and bludgeoning damage. Some creatures, usually constructs, have resistances that can only be bypassed by adamantine weapons.

## Elixir of the Valinor’s Heart

Potion, very rare

Description: This ornate crystal vial contains a viscous red fluid.

History: Said to have been created by the val’Mehan family during the ancient Blood Wars, the formula for creating this potion was discovered by the Emerald Society during an expedition in the Blessed Lands. Since creating one draught of this elixir requires the complete exsanguination of a val, it was considered too dangerous for public consumption and so consigned to the Vaults of Forbidden Knowledge in New Althre’. Nevertheless, the formula made its way into grimoires of various black sorcerers, witches and unscrupulous Sarishans across the Known Lands.

Abilities/Effects: This elixir grants the drinker the bloodline abilities of a single val family, with the specific powers being dictated by which val was used to create the elixir. For 1 hour after imbibing this elixir, you gain one of the following benefits as appropriate:

If you are a val of a different bloodline from the elixir, you suppress your own powers and replace them with powers chosen from the potion’s bloodline. You may only access a number of bloodline powers equal to those you already have (for example, if you have 3 val bloodline powers presently, you may only access 3 bloodline powers of equivalent level of the val bloodline of the elixir).

If you are not a val you gain no benefits from this elixir, and instead suffer 4d10 poison damage and are poisoned for 1 hour.

#### Fury Elixir

Potion, uncommon

Description: This milky mixture is usually contained in a metal flask, which bubbles and sizzles when unstopped.

History: First gaining popularity in the gladiatorial arenas of Sicaris, Eppion, and Plexus, the elixir was a closely guarded secret as use of magical or alchemical enhancements are frowned upon. It remained so until the funerary games of the Emperor Calcestus val’Assante. There, a second-rate gladiator butchered a very skilled and favorite fighter of the new emperor. After an investigation, the gladiator confessed to taking the concoction and soon thereafter use of the fury elixir has been prohibited. Even though the elixir blesses the user with greatly enhanced physical attributes and the ability to ignore pain, it later ravages the mind and body leaving many a gladiator an empty husk.

Abilities/Effects: Upon drinking this potion you gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, as well as gaining a +1d4 bonus on melee damage rolls for 10 minutes. Afterwards, you gain 1 level of exhaustion.

#### Ghoststep Draught

Potion, very rare

Description: Requiring a lengthy Beltinian prayer over a flask of ectoplasm residue from a forcefully dissipated spirit or shade, the ghoststep draught is one of the rarest and most difficult potions to produce.

History: Believed known only to the Beltinian high priests for use in their most sacred rituals travelers to the Hinterlands have witnessed the Ehtzara use a similar potion to achieve the same results. Scholars are unsure if this is merely a product of parallel development or if there is some heretofore unknown link between the Beltinians and these erratic shamans.

Abilities/Effects: Once you drink this potion your physical form begins to dissipate, taking on the qualities of an incorporeal creature, gaining the Incorporeal Movement and Ethereal Sight special traits of a ghost for 1 minute.

#### Holy Tiger Draught

Potion, rare

Description: This fiery tasting green potion is typically found within a decorative gourd painted or carved with stalking tigers and jungle motifs.

History: This exotic elixir originated among the cannibal Nung tribe located far to the west, on one of the many archipelagos of the Messalean Sea. The tribe’s witch doctor prepares the draught from sacred peppers, a fresh kill and invocations to the spirit of the fearsome striped hunter that stalks the land. Though savage, the Nung do understand and appreciate the strange and exotic trinkets that come from trade. Far ranging Chauni and Dailish pirates have managed to acquire the recipe and have sold it to alchemists and scholars across the Known Lands.

Abilities/Effects: When you drink this magical potion your hands become muscular and paw-like with retractable claws. For the next hour, your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 slashing damage. In addition, when taking the Attack action, you may make an additional unarmed strike as a bonus action.

If you possess the Martial Arts class feature you may choose to deal bludgeoning, slashing or piercing damage with your unarmed strikes. 

#### Mindfire

Potion, very rare

Description: This clear liquid tastes sweet and produces a pleasant tingling to the user’s lips.

History: This potion is brewed from the crushed petals of the rare prince’s flower and has become quite popular among scribes and sages thought the Known Lands. Though its benefits are tangible, it takes a terrible toll upon the body. What some imbibers feel is even worse is that prince’s flower is only found upon the Isle of Tears, the home of the dreaded Sorcerer-King and his Harvesters. Originally created by the Ymandrake Wine Drinkers, they often demand payment in the form of information on the whereabouts of arcane spellcasters in exchange for another vial.

Abilities/Effects: When you drink this potion you add double your proficiency bonus on Intelligence and Wisdom ability checks for 1 hour. Afterwards, you suffer 1 level of exhaustion.

#### Oil of Beast Repulsion

Potion, rare

Description: This murky liquid has an unexpectedly floral scent, and is applied topically. If ingested, it acts as a mild poison, inducing violent vomiting for ld4 hours.

History: Brewed by the Pengik from extracts gathered across their traditional lands, this oil is made from the squeezing of the rare iyaye vine, a dangerous crawling plant that is only found in the remote parts of the Pricklespur Forest.

Bits of various animals must then be boiled into the potion.

Beasts that fail their save remain frightened as long as they can see you and must move to the nearest safe spot where they cannot see you.

If they then come back within 30 feet of you, they may make a new saving throw. Once a beast succeeds on their saving throw, they are unaffected by the oil for its duration. Creatures that cannot smell automatically succeed on their saving throw.

 

#### Oil of Deflection

Potion, rare

Description: Stored in a hinged shell of a small turtle, this salve is created from a mixture of herbs and a pungent mold that grows deep within swamps and marshes. Rumors persist of additional, if less savory, ingredients but what these are is something that the ss’ressen priestesses are unwilling to share. After letting the concoction cool after boiling, it creates a smelly paste that is applied by smearing it over the user’s body.

History: Crafted by specially trained ss’ressen priestesses, the salve is used to provide ss’ressen warriors with an equal footing against the heavier armored humans of Milandir and Coryan.

Abilities/Effects: Each shell holds 3 applications of oil of deflection. Each application covers a Medium or smaller creature. Applying this oil takes 1 minute, but once applied, you gain a +1 bonus to your AC for the next hour.

#### Oil of Puissance

Potion, rare

Description: This clear oil has a metallic smell and is brewed by priests of Nier or Hurrian.

History: This oil was first developed by Taliose val’Virdan, an alchemist in service to the Sword of the Heavens. He was later captured by rebel forces and ‘persuaded’ to reveal the formula before being buried up to his neck and left near a colony of tiger ants on the edge of the Haunted Wastes.

Abilities/Effects: You gain 10 temporary hit points and have advantage on Strength and Constitution saving throws for 1 minute.

#### Oil of Pyrotechnics

Potion, rare

Description: Appearing to look like common olive oil, these potions typically come in fragile ceramic or glass containers. The liquid is a highly reactive explosive, without the viscosity of alchemist’s fire. When used as a grenade-like weapon, it explodes with devastating consequences.

History: These oils were first encountered by Coryani legions during their war with the Khitani, who were fond of using this explosive concoction to devastating effect.

Abilities/Effects: As an action, you can throw this vial up to 20 feet, where it shatters on impact and the liquid within explodes on contact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or an object, 

treating the vial as an improvised weapon. Every creature in a 10-foot radius around where the vial breaks must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. An affected creature takes 3d8 fire and 3d8 thunder damage, or half as much on a successful saving throw. This explosion is quite loud and can be clearly heard hundreds of feet away.

O#### il of Scent Masking

Potion, uncommon

Description: This amber colored oil is odorless. When applied, this oil masks the scent of the wearer.

History: This oil was first discovered being used by poachers raiding the preserves of Balantica to avoid the hounds and other beasts used to safeguard the area. When questioned, the poachers couldn’t identify who sold them the oil. The ruling val’Dellenov family believes that it must have been the neighboring val’Borda family, testing the oil’s efficacy before issuing it to their spies. For their part, the scions of Cadic vehemently deny any such accusations.

Abilities/Effects: After spreading this oil upon your body, any creature who attempts to track or locate you though scent suffers disadvantage on their ability checks for the next three hours. Even if the creature normally has advantage while using scent, the power of this oil is so overpowering the creature still suffers disadvantage.

#### Potion of Bloodmastery

Potion, (lesser) rare; (greater) very rare

Description: This potion is dark red, almost the purple of a bruise, with a silver effervesce when unstopped.

History: Seeking a way to emulate the ability some mages wield Adkir, a member of the Ymandrake Order of Wine Drinkers, studied and experimented around the clock, much to the agony of his test subjects, until he unlocked the secret of the formulae. Through a laborious process, he was able to distill the very essence in a sorcerer’s blood that allows him to manipulate arcane power. After hurriedly preparing his first vial of it, he presented it to Order. Needless to say, his superiors were most pleased and Adkir’s worth to the Wine Drinkers soared.

Only accomplished Wine Drinkers are allowed access to the lesser bloodmastery potion and the secret of its creation, while only the highest-ranking Wine Drinkers have access to the greater bloodmastery potion. Adkir has recently perfected an even more powerful bloodmastery potion that emulates specific val family bloodline abilities, but gleefully waits to demonstrate its marvelous efficiency in a large-scale slaughter of some kind. His Order finds this amusing. The vals certainly won’t.

Abilities/Effects: When casting a spell, you may drink this potion as an additional material component. Its effects depend on the rarity of the potion. If you drink this potion and you are not a Wine Drinker, you suffer disadvantage on any saving throw against spells until the beginning of your next turn, in addition to its other effects.

Lesser bloodmastery: Your spell is cast as if you used a spell slot 1 level higher, even if you do not possess the appropriate spell slot.

Greater bloodmastery: Your spell is cast as if you used a spell slot one-level higher, even if you do not possess a higher level slot. In addition, if your target has blood or internal fluid of some kind, you have advantage on your spell attack roll and give disadvantage on your target’s saving throw against the spells effects, if any.

#### Potion of Mist

Potion, rare

Description: This clear viscous liquid seems to shimmer when held up to the light.

History: Commissioned by a group of thieves, the dwarven Master Alchemist Rodin, the Encali knew a great business opportunity when he saw one. He freely sold hundreds of vials of his creation to anyone who could meet his price. His monopoly was eventually broken when the formula was stolen, the robber vanishing without a trace, but for a thin trail of haze.

Abilities/Effects: You After drinking this potion, for 1 minute you may spend your reaction to surround yourself in silvery mist and teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see.

#### Potion of Poison Spittle

Potion, rare

Description: Swirling green fluid fills this glass phial, usually marked with a spitting asp on the side.

History: A cache of vials filled with this potion was discovered in a cave near the Canyon of Zhu. While only forty bottles of the mixture were found, others have been found in and near the Abessian Dominion throughout the years. Possession of this item is illegal in most nations of the Known Lands.

Abilities/Effects: After drinking this potion, for 1 minute you may, as a bonus action you may spit poison at a target you can see. Make a ranged attack against a creature within 30 feet, treating your poison spittle as an improvised weapon. Any creature struck suffers 3d8 poison damage and must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. 

#### Potion of Putrescence

Potion, uncommon

Description: This vile liquid is sickly green in color and is usually held in a putrescent skin.

History: Fanatical Nerothians aspiring to one day receive the blessing of Neroth and join the ranks of undead, use this potion to emulate their betters. Once ingratiated into their court, they make themselves subservient to their undead lords, seeking guidance, tutelage, and performing tasks delegated by their masters, in the hopes of being granted life beyond life.

Abilities/Effects: Once you drink this disgusting potion, for 1 minute, any creature within 10 feet that possesses a sense of smell must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned by your noxious scent until they are more than 10 feet away from you. For the next hour, you have advantage on all Charisma checks when attempting to feign death, appearing to all as a corpse.

#### Potion of Satiety


Potion, rare

History: These potions can usually be acquired at shrines or temples to the goddess Anshar, especially those near the frontier, where finding fresh water and food is uncertain.

Abilities/Effects: You require neither food nor drink for 1d4 days + your Constitution modifier after drinking this potion. You suffer no ill effects of thirst or starvation during this time, even those that would be inflicted through supernatural means. You may eat and drink during this time without ill effect. Once the duration has ended, you must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or gain 2 levels of exhaustion.

If you drink this potion while you have levels of exhaustion, you immediately vomit up the potion and do not gain any of its effects.

#### Potion of Steely Nerves

Potion, uncommon

Description: This purple liquid is easily identified by its pungent odor and fiery taste.

History: First crafted by the Milandisian priests of Hurrian for those marching towards the horrors of Canceri during the Heretic War, this potion now enjoys widespread use across the Known Lands.

Abilities/Effects: For 1 hour after imbibing this potion, you have advantage on all saving throws against any effect that would make you frightened.

#### Potion of Uncanny Alertness

Potion, rare

Description: This potion at first appears colorless but when held in the sunlight it is revealed to have a faint blue tint.

History: Used by explorers of the Emerald Society when delving into ancient catacombs or in the pervasive lightless caverns of the Endless Dark, this potion has saved many lives by revealing chasms and dead drops that would have otherwise been invisible.

imbibing this potion, you have advantage on all Wisdom (Perception) checks and your passive Perception increases by +5. Unfortunately, your increased sensitivity of vision and hearing makes you vulnerable to bright lights and loud sounds, giving you disadvantage on saving throws against light or sound based attacks during the duration of the potion.

#### 

Potion, uncommon

Description: These oils were once stored in glass upon which were inscribed prayers and benedictions of the various Gods. During the Fifth Crusade, common tin flasks were used and reused due to the King’s orders to produce large quantities of the oil.

History: Once a rare commodity and given sparingly to only the most pious and worthy, sanctified oils were produced in large quantities by order of King Osric during the Fifth Crusade of Light. So commonplace were these sacred oils that the soldiers began to irreverently calling it, “the Gods’ spit”. With their stores of ingredients depleted, temple priests were unable to produce the quantities demanded of them twenty years later at the inception of the Sixth Crusade of Light, leading to a higher mortality rate among the rank and file in their battles against Infernals.

Abilities/Effects: As an action you may apply this oil on a non-magical weapon, shield or suit of armor. If applied to a weapon, the weapon becomes temporarily magical, 

granting a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls with that weapon. If applied to a shield or armor, it grants a +1 bonus to AC while wearing the armor or holding the shield. This effect lasts for 1 hour.

#### Voei Skin Salve

Potion, very rare

Description: This clay jar contains a brownish-green liquid with the viscosity of syrup. When applied to the bare skin, flesh takes on a thick and warty quality, darkening slightly, and giving off a cinnamon aroma.

History: The formula for this noxious salve was discovered by Calyce val’Dellenov during an expedition to the Fervidus Hills. Her party of explorers came across the deserted encampment of a tribe of savage Voei. While the rest of the expedition sifted for rare Voei artifacts, Calyce stumbled upon the dwelling of the tribe’s witchdoctor. Among the many strange items in the hut, she came across a sample of a strange salve. When applied to the skin, the flesh becomes hard and warty, taking on a brown tinge and making it resistant to many types of harm.

After years of experimentation mostly on herself, Calyce was able to replicate the recipe and manufacture more of the paste. Unfortunately, Calyce also learned that the salve has an addictive quality to it, until eventually, the being that was Calyce val’Dellenov was cornered and incinerated, ending her homicidal rampage throughout the streets of Old Coryan.

Abilities/Effects: You cannot apply this paste if you have levels of exhaustion. Once applied, the paste remains active for 1 hour. While active, you heal 10 hit points of damage at the beginning of your turn. This healing is suppressed for 1 round if you suffer acid or fire damage.

If you are reduced to 0 hit points while under the effects of this potion, you automatically succeed on all death saving throws, and begin to regain hit points after your third death save. If you suffer acid or fire damage while below 0 hit points, you automatically fail your death saving throws as normal for suffering damage while unconscious.

After this paste wears off, you gain 1 level of exhaustion.

#### War Paints of the Skohir

Potion, very rare

Description: These body paints are fashioned by Skohir shamans from the paste made from red seaweed found in the shallows of islands known only to them. This paste is mixed during a complex ritual while with various herbs, roots and seeds to create pastes of different colors and textures, while appealing to various spirits to empower the mixiuie.

History: Used by the Skohir during raids or for rare standing battles against rival Yhing-hir tribes or Milandisians, it makes these formidable warriors even more deadly and fearsome.

Abilities/Effects: The war paint requires 1 hour to apply as the application must be precise and pleasing to the spirits. For 1 hour, these pigments protect you, granting an AC of 14 + your Dexterity modifier. In addition, the war paint grants different effects depending upon the type of pigment applied.

Red war paint gives advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws

Blue gives advantage on Intelligence and Wisdom saving throws

Violet affords a +1d4 bonus to all weapon damage rolls.

Black grants the ability to take the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn as well as the benefits of the pass without trace spell (self-only, no concentration required).


## Mastercraft Items 

A mastercraft item is an item created with such skill and care that it is clearly superior to a normal item. Not just any craftsmen can create a mastercraft item; only an expert in his or her craft, with exceptional skill and years of experience, can create such an item. Mastercraft items can take the form of weapons, armor, or tools. All mastercraft items are exceptionally durable and can take wear and tear better than a normal item. Although mastercraft items are not magical, magic items are mastercraft items, but their magical description and properties replaces any benefit they grant from being mastercraft.

### Mastercraft weapons

Mastercraft weapons are particularly sharp and sturdy. You gain a +1 bonus to damage rolls made with a mastercraft weapon. Your weapon is less likely to break under normal use. Ammunition generally cannot be mastercrafted. If a mastercraft weapon gains a bonus to damage from any other source, that bonus replaces the bonus granted from the weapon being a mastercraft weapon. Mastercraft weapons cost 300 GPs more than the base price of the weapon. A mastercraft weapon can also be silvered, but this costs an additional 100 GPs. 

### Mastercraft Armor 

Mastercraft armor and shields provide the same protection as their normal counterparts but weigh less. Mastercraft light armor, medium armor, and shields weigh half as much as normal. Mastercraft heavy armor weighs three-quarters as much as normal. The strength score required to wear mastercraft heavy armor before one's speed is reduced is one point less than the listed score. Mastercraft armor and shields are less likely to break under normal use. They cost twice as much as their normal counterparts.

### Mastercraft Tools 

Mastercraft tools are created with such quality that they make it easier for you to use them. You gain a +1 bonus to any check you make with a mastercraft tool with which you are proficient. They are more durable under normal use. Mastercraft tools cost four times as much as their normal counterparts.

**Hides & Leathers Dragon Leather: Armor \(leather, studded leather, scale mail, hide\):** The powerful virtues of dragon's hide can be invested into suits of armor made of the material by cunning craftsmen. When you're wearing armor made from it, you reduce the damage taken from slashing and piercing injuries by 1. You additionally reduce damage taken from a single damage type that corresponds with the original dragon's breath weapon by 1 \(fire for red dragons, lightning for blue, etc\). Wearers are warned, however, that dragons do take ill to those they encounter wearing this. Metals Adamantine: An alloy of adamant, silver, and electrum, or of steel and mithral, it is black in color, with a green sheen in candlelight or a purple-white light in magical radiance. 

**Armor \(Chain shirt, scale mail, breastplate, half plate; ring mail, chain mail, splint, plate\):** Adamant makes armor of exquisite diamond-hard substance. While you're wearing it, any critical hit against you becomes a normal hit. Weapons: Though adamantine weapons have no additional properties, adamantine takes and holds magic quite well. Many magical weapons are wrought of adamantine because of this. 

**Adamant:** A gleaming, glossy black refinement of adamantine, a natural jet-black ferromagnetic ore found in obsidian beds. It is gleaming, glossy black, with a rainbow sheen in bright light. It is too brittle to make keen weapons from, but is a favorite of dwarf-folk for hammers. **Armor \(Chain shirt, scale mail, ring mail, chain mail, splint\):** Though this jet black metal is too fragile to form actual armor, strips of it can be used to reinforce flexible armors. It strengthens the armor minutely, but its main property is to partially absorb fire. You reduce all slashing damage by 1, and all fire damage by 1d6. In any combat in which you take bludgeoning damage, however, roll a d20 at the end of the combat. If you roll a 9 or lower, the strips of adamant have been shattered and will need to be repaired **\(which costs 20% of the cost to install the reinforcements\)** by a smith skilled in the working of adamant. Until repairs are done, you lose all benefits of this material. Weapons **\(bludgeoning\):** When you have advantage on an attack roll, if the lower of the two dice would also hit your target's AC, you inflict an additional d4 damage. 

**Arandur:** Once the exclusive secret of the gnome-kind, arandur is a gleaming silver-blue metal, with a green reflective sheen in sunlight. It also naturally absorbs the magical injuries used to inflict raw kinetic injuries. **Armor \(scale mail, breastplate, half plate; splint, plate; shield\):** When used to make non-flexible metal armors, arandur grants its wearer the ability to reduce force damage by 2. Weapons **\(slashing or piercing\):** Arandur can be honed to wicked edges that are not easily dulled. When you inflict a critical with a slashing or piercing weapons wrought of arandur, add your Proficiency bonus to the final damage total. 

**Darksteel:** A silvery metal with a shadowed cast that gleams purple-ish in firelight, darksteel's making is lost today, an ancient secret of teh Ironstar clan of dwarves. Smiths throughout the Realms offer great amounts of gold for the recovery of any lost ingots of the metal. **Armor \(Chain shirt, scale mail, breastplate, half plate; ring mail, chain mail, splint, plate\):** Armor wrought of darksteel reduces all bludgeoning and lightning damage inflicted to the wearer by 1. 

**Dlarun:** A little known halfling metal dug up from clumps of river clay and then kilned at high temperatures, dlarun is a bone-white metal that can take a high polish, and gains a distinctive greenish sheen under magical lighting. It has the strange benefit of steadying the minds of those that wear it. **Armor \(Studded leather; breastplate, half plate; splint, plate; shield\):** Armor wrought of dlarun reduces all bludgeoning and psychic damage by 1, and grants a +1 to saves against all Enchantment spells. 

**Gold:** Though quite precious, gold is still considered one of the "common metals." Gold is aligned with solar and celestial magics, purifying undeath. Gold continually flakes and chips away, however, necessitating constant **\(although simple\) repairs. Armor \(any\):** Though gold is too soft to make armor from, while wearing gold-filigreed armor, reduce all necrotic damage taken by 1. For each item of armor possessed and used, add the following costs to your Lifestyle expenditures per month: 1sp for light armor or shield, 5sp for medium armor, 1gp for heavy armor. **Weapon \(any\):** Gold-filigreed weapons used to strike the undead inflict 1 additional point of radiant damage. For each such weapon, add 2sp to your Lifestyle cost expenditures per month.

**Mithral:** Called the "truemetal" by dwarf-folk, mithral is derived from soft, glittering, silvery-black ore found in rare veins and pockets from the depths of the Underdark to surface rocks. 
**Armor \(chain shirt, scale mail, breastplate, half plate; ring mail, chain mail, splint, plate; shield\):** Mithral lends subtlety and grace to the wearer. If the armor normally inflicts disadvantage on Stealth rolls, that property is negated. If it does not, then the armor can be worn normally under clothes without giving away the fact that the wearer is wearing armor. **Weapons \(slashing or piercing\):** The fine edge of mithral is sung about in elven ballads, and with good reason. When you have advantage on an attack roll, if the lower of the two dice would also hit your target's AC, you inflict an additional d4 damage. 

**Silver:** Another common metal, silver is aligned with the powers and mysteries of Selûne. **Weapon \(any\):** Many creatures take grievous wounds from silvered weapons. Though the metal is too soft and costly to make weapons from directly, weapons can easily be silvered with the stuff, granting the property of the metal without taking away from its utility. 

**Telstang:** Originally a gnomish secret, this alloy of copper, mithral, platinum, and silver is a dull pewter-silver in hue, and gives off a clear bell-like tone when struck with another metal \(leading to its other name of "singing metal"\). It also collects and reverberates sudden sonic assaults outward away from itself. **Armor \(Scale mail, breastplate, half plate; splint, plate\):** Though telstang's construction make it largely unsuitable for armors, some craft them anyway for its two tremendous benefits. The first is that any sonic damage taken by the wearer is reduced by 1d6 points. The second is that the wearer automatically succeeds at any saving throws that paralyze or change his shape. Any critical hit with bludgeoning or force damage shatters your armor, however \(though this critical hit only inflicts normal damage instead of doubling it\). Metal Treatments These are alchemical and metallurgical treatments used to treat specific kinds of metals.

**Blueshine:** Metal weapons and armor. A treatment that gives a bluish sheen to any items wrought of iron, steel, adamantine, arandur, darksteel, mithral, silver, or telstang, blueshine helps negate caustic substances. The metal part of weapons coated in the stuff become immune to acid damage, and armors coated in it grant resistance to acid damage: reduce all acid damage taken by 1 for medium armors or 2 for heavy armors. 

**Everbright:** Metal weapons and armor. A dwarven process now known to smiths of many folk, everbright-treated items gleam with a mirror finish \(like a chromium finish\). Metal objects \(which can only be made of steel, adamantine, or mithral\) treated with everbright are immune to rust and the passage of time, and those wearing armor or bearing shields treated with it reduce radiant damage taken by 1 for medium armors and shields or 2 for heavy armors. Remaining unseen while wearing such armor is quite difficult, however; those searching visually for everbright-clad characters gain advantage on their checks to spot them. Halabar's Stealth: Metal weapons and armor. An expensive but increasingly common metal treatment that renders metallic weapons and armor nonferromagnetic, nonreflective, and wholly silent, not even clanging when struck against other metals or stone. Drawing or wielding such weapons will not reveal a hidden character, and metal armor wrought of it does not inflict disadvantage on Stealth checks.

# Снаряжение для Паладина

Паладины крайне серьезно относятся к своему снаряжению, и всегда стараются купить самое лучшее. Своим снаряжением они не только подчеркивают  честь своего положения; для некоторых  снаряжение символизирует их принципы.

• Щит символизирует клятву паладина придерживаться своего этоса. 

• Меч символизирует тех кого он поклялся защищать: одна грань аристократию, вторая обычных людей.

• Доспехи являются символом его отношения к власти. Как доспехи защищает его тело, так же он должен защищать своего монарха.

• Шлем олицетворяет собой его религию. Так же как шлем защищает его голову, так же он должен защищать свою церковь.

• Одежда, хорошей выделки и безупречно чистая, символизирует чистоту духа.

## Стандартное Снаряжение

Вещи из следующего списка имеют почти все паладины. Обычно, эти вещи приобретаются из лишних денег паладина. Обычно паладины стараются поддерживать свои вещи в идеальном состоянии, следовательно, они редко требуют замены.

### Доспехи

Паладину доступны все виды доспехов. При наличии выбора, более предпочтителен полный латный доспехи. Но, из-за дороговизны полного латного или простого латного доспехов, некоторые останавливаются на пластинчатом или плетеном доспехе, или даже кольчуге. Кожаный, клепаный кожаный и набивной, включая магические, обычно игнорируются, поскольку эти доспехи обычно ассоциируются с людьми более низкого класса. Паладин скорее предпочтет обычную кольчугу, чем клепаную кожу +3.

В большинстве миров  паладин предпочитают следующий набор доспехов: хаубрек/шлем (или то и другое вместе), кольчуга и латный доспей.

Хаубрек и шлем. Небогатые паладины, обычно из примитивных государств, или же те, кто только начинает свою карьеру, обычно носят только хаубрек (часть кольчуги, закрывающая грудь) и шлем. Обычно паладин сам делает хаубрек, наматывая проволоку вокруг палки, затем, отрезая куски, так что бы получились кольца. Затем он выравнивает их при помощи молота, затем заклепывает их вместе, так что бы они приняли форму тела, по длине до колен и с капюшоном накрывающим голову. Шлем обычно заостряющийся к верху и с открытым лицом. Комбинация хаубрека и шлема гораздо дешевле, чем кольчуги, но и имеет АС 7.

Кольчуга. Хаубрек вместе с кольчужными леггинсами и защитой для рук составляет кольчугу (AC 5). На шлеме также можно добавить козырек для лучшей защиты лица. Несмотря на то, что кольчуга относительно недорога и сравнительно легка, у нее так же есть свои недостатки. Во-первых, вес очень неравномерно распределяется по телу и ложится в основном на плечи. И даже самый сильный человек устанет, если будет целый день, не снимая носить кольчугу. Мастер так же может назначить штраф -2 ко всем броскам атаки этого человека (если он больше 24 часов не снимая, носит кольчугу).

Хотя бы раз в неделю, кольчугу надо смазывать маслом и полировать, процесс этот занимает часа 3-4.  Если за ней не ухаживать, то через месяц она придет в негодность, АС будет ухудшаться на один за каждый месяц без надлежащего ухода.

Латный доспех. Латы (AC 3) включает в себя нагрудник, наспинник, и полоски металла на ноги и на руки, в общем, на те места, которые не защищает кольчуга. Листы металла называющиеся pauldrons защищают места между руками и грудью. Эпольеты (наплечники) защищают верх туловища; латные рукавицы (металлические перчатки) защищают руки.

Высокоуровневые паладины иногда украшают свои латы (латные перчатки, шлемы) золотыми или серебряными украшениями или небольшими бриллиантами. Эти вещи совместимы с этосом паладина, который должен по своему статусу производить хорошее впечатление, но не может копить и афишировать богатства. Геральдические символы могут быть выгравированы или нарисованы на любых местах латного доспеха.

Латный доспех тоже должен полироваться и смазываться маслом, но поскольку он состоит из более крупных частей, нежели колечки у кольчуги, то он меньше подвержен ржавлению. Хотя латный доспех заметно тяжелее кольчужного, но его вес лучше распределяется по телу, за счет чего люди носящие его меньше устают.

### Щиты

Большинство паладинов используют средний щит, поскольку он предоставляет хорошую фронтальную и боковую защиту и достаточно легок, для того чтобы использовать его верхом. Обычно они сделаны из дерева и обтянуты толстой кожей, имеют треугольную форму с округлой вершиной и заостренными нижними углами. Сам щит выпуклый и размером примерно 4 - 5 футов. Паладин держит его в левой руке (или правой, если он левша) за специальную ручку, которая находится с внутренней стороны щита.

Некоторые паладины предпочитают прямоугольные, круглые или даже пятиугольные щиты. Щит может быть отделан золотом, серебром, бриллиантами, на нем могут быть выгравированы геральдические знаки или же он просто может быть ярко раскрашен.

### Оружие

Хотя паладин может владеть любым оружием, но большинство чувствуют себя неуютно без меча (длинного, двуручного, полуторного, а может быть даже и короткого), копья (среднего или тяжелого) и кинжала. Обычно паладин носит свой меч в ножнах на поясе, в этом случае с другой стороны висит кинжал.

Так же паладины могут иметь следующие оружия цеп всадника, булава всадника, пика всадника, боевой топор и скимитар. К метательному оружию паладины равнодушны, так как оно тяжело в использовании, если ты на коне.

Турнирное копье, хотя и предпочтительно, обычно очень дорого. За место этого, паладин может на наконечник обычного копья надеть деревянную заглушку и тем самым сделать его пригодным для турниров. Заглушка же эта может оказаться ненадежной; есть 5% шанс, в течение поединка, (1 на 1d20), что она отвалиться. В этом случае поединок приостанавливается и начинается заново.  Боец, постоянно теряющий заглушку для копья, может быть дисквалифицирован.

### Одежда и Специальные Предметы 

Выбирая одежду, паладин пытается объединить в ней функциональность и элегантность. Он предпочитает яркие, насыщенные цвета (синий, красный, зеленый, фиолетовый) и, когда может себе это позволить, дорогую ткань (шелк, вельвет). Поскольку паладина часто встречают по внешнему виду, трата денег на дорогую одежду и снаряжение не считается нарушением этоса.

Идеальный гардероб, который паладин приобретает в течение своей карьеры, состоит из следующих вещей:

• Две строгие шелковые или льняные рубашки с длинными рукавами.

• Две пары бриджей или брюк, плотно облегающих ноги, сделанных из шерсти, хлопка или льна, (брюки широкого покроя обычно ассоциируются с крестьянами или низкими по статусу людьми). Бриджи обычно до колен и ярко раскрашены.

• Подкладка к доспехам (из мягкой кожи или подбитой ткани, носимая под кольчугой, что бы предотвратить натирание.

• Две пары шелковых носков.

• Пара сапог для верховой езды.

• Пара кожаных туфель, обычно, заостренных к носу  и застегивающихся на щиколотке.

• Две туники, длиной до колена и надевающихся через голову, обычно без рукавов. Туники могут быть украшены рисунками или же драгоценностями.

• Накидка, так же без рукавов. Накидка обычно окаймлена мехом, со всякими кисточками, ленточками.

• Легкая мантия для весны и лета, из хлопка или шелка, застегивающаяся на горле при помощи застежки.

• Зимняя мантия подбитая бобровым, лисьим или другим теплым мехом.

• Широкий кожаный ремень, с железной пряжкой.

• Шерстяная хлопковая или фетровая шапка.

• Церемониальный чепец (плотно сидящая шапка, закрывающая волосы и уши, подвязанная под подбородком) из льна или шелка, украшенная вышивками, перьями или золотыми нитями. Обычно он нужен для правительственных банкетов или церковных церемоний. Женщина паладины используют церемониальный платок.

• Два хлопковых или шерстяных полотенца (одно для умывания, второй в роли скатерти).

• Столовые приборы: вилки, ложки, ножи, чашки, тарелки, бокалы. Эти вещи должны быть из серебра, золота, хрусталя.

• Полное снаряжение для своей лошади.

• Два теплых одеяла, одно для себя, второе для лошади.

• Зеркало (необходимо для ухода за лошадью).

### Формальная Одежда Для Паладинов Женщин

Женщины паладины могут носить всю вышеперечисленную одежду. Для формальных церемоний, женщины паладины могут носить, тунику до пола, называемую килт (kirtle), которая плотно облегает грудь, бедра и ноги. Женщины также носят чулки, на подвязках, а вот обувь для всех одинакова. 

## Эмблемы, Штандарты и Навершия

Паладины часто украшают свои доспехи, щиты, одежду или оружия надписями или символами которые символизируют их ранг, церковь или короля. За определенные поступки церковь или монарх могут преподнести в дар паладину какие-либо украшения, которые будут свидетельствовать о его поступках:

Эмблема. Эмблемы символизируют родину паладина, его семью или Орден. Эмблема может быть как медальоном, подвязкой, так же это может быть гравировка на доспехах, щите, оружии или вышивка на одежде. Обычные символы: люди со звериными головами, цветок или дерево с короной,  оружие с крыльями.

Штандарт. Штандарт это флаг с  Y-видной верхушкой, на длинном древке. Штандарт может  включать в себя набор цветов, геральдические символы или знаки различия церкви или правительства паладина. Штандарт становится знаменем,  когда его обрезают так, чтобы он стал квадратным. Небольшой штандарт, называется флажок и может прикрепляться на копье.

Навершие. Навершием может сложить пучок кожаных полосок, несколько перьев, деревянная резьба, кисточка или любой другой маленький предмет прикрепленный к шлему паладина. Навершие обычно того же цвета, что и щит паладина. Обычно их одевают на турниры, что бы можно было отличить одного паладина от другого,  но некоторые паладины носят их всегда. Навершие так же можно надевать на гриву или уздечку боевой лошади.

## Дополнительное Снаряжение

Священное писание. В священном писании записаны все постулаты веры персонажа, молитвы, принципы поведения, требования со стороны божества, а также другой теологический материал. Священное писание не является книгой заклинаний и никак не помогает при их сотворении.

Поскольку священное писание может быть очень дорогим, персонажи иногда просят церковь предоставить им его  в рассрочку, добавляя по несколько золотых монет к своей обычной десятине, но если церковь богата, то она может безвозмездно предоставить своему паладину священное писание. Но в этом случае если паладин теряет книгу, то он обязан выплатить ее стоимость церкви.

Герб. Обычно это относится к геральдическим рисункам на щитах или доспехах паладина, но иногда может означать определенный тип одежды, например, белая туника, носимая поверх доспехов, украшенная геральдическими символами паладина. Такая туника, во-первых, дает возможность другим понять, кто стоит перед ними, а во-вторых, может спасти от перегревания в очень жаркую погоду.

Косметический набор. Очень полезен при подготовке к какому-либо официальному приему или банкету, косметический набор обычно содержит: кусок овечьего жира, что бы сделать кожу блестящей, румяна, сделать щеки белыми или розовыми, тальк для тела с легким, приятным запахом, а так же приспособления для бритья.

Набор для ухода за лошадью. Для эффективного и полного ухода за лошадью, этот набор включает в себя скребок (для отряхивания  грязи с шерсти),  бритва (для срезания лишних волос), губка для тела (для удаления грязи с ног, копыт и других мест, где не подходит скребок), щипцы (доставлять камни застрявшие в копытах), и расческу для гривы и хвоста (чтобы очистить и расчесать волосы).

Похожие наборы существуют для всех видов животных.

Султан. Представляет из себя пучок связанных перьев, ленточек, кисточек, переплетенных с тонкими металлическими проволоками. Султаны прикрепляется на шлем (возможно, по бокам), края щитов, защищая глаза от яркого света. Так же они несколько замедляют коррозию и помогают отражать удары.  Обычно они раскрашены в те же цвета, что и щит паладина. 

Саше. Небольшая сумочка, в которой хранятся смеси цветков, трав  специй, которые придают приятный запах одежде. Саше может, хранится где угодно.

Шпоры. Со шпорами значительно легче управлять своей лошадью, так как есть возможность отдавать команды легким движением ноги. Лучшие шпоры те, которые не причиняют боли животному, они имеют колесики определенной формы, за место острых концов.

## Новое Магическое Снаряжение

**Сбруя полета:** Сбруя полета похожа на обычную сбрую, для лошади, слона или любого другого спутника. Когда  надета на спутника паладина,  сбруя полета может, по команде паладина, выращивать металлические крылья, длиной примерно в две длины спутника. Эти крылья позволяют спутнику летать со скоростью его обычного передвижения и иметь класс Маневренности С. Естественно животное, одетое в эту сбрую, может летать так, как если бы умело летать всегда.

Паладин, который не владеет профессией Воздушной Верховой Езды, получает штраф -2 к своим броскам атаки и должен делать проверку Ловкости тогда, когда скажет Мастер, персонаж владеющий этой профессией никаких неудобств не испытывает.

Крылья держатся 1d4 часа в день; спутник инстинктивно чувствует, что время полета подходит к концу и всегда успевает вовремя приземлиться.

**Уздечка спокойствия:** Эта уздечка, когда надета на спутника паладина, позволяет ему избегать всех эффектов магического страха. Что касаемо морали,  уздечка спокойствия делает бесстрашным  спутника паладина (мораль 19-20). Ее можно использовать как на спутниках, так и на обычных животных.

**Султан призывания:** Когда находится на шлеме паладина, султан призывания позволяет ему телепатически призвать своего спутника, на расстоянии 10 миль на уровень. Если спутник попал в плен, или по каким то другим причинам не способен вернуться к паладину, он чуствует тупую боль вокруг глаз, как бы то ни было, паладин не может узнать точного местонахождения спутника.

**Масло гармонии:** Если этим маслом полностью смазать любой металлический доспех, то его АС улучшается на 1 на 24 часа.   AC не может стать меньше 0. Процесс смазывания доспеха занимает 1-2 часа, в зависимости от его размеров.

**Ножны сохранности:** Меньше фута длиной, эти кожаные ножны, казалось бы, подходят только для кинжала. Но, на самом деле, в них убирается любое оружие любого размера (от ножа до алебарды). Когда часть оружия попадает в ножны, оно все уменьшается до размеров кинжала. Оружие можно достать только при помощи кодового слова или заклинания удар (knock). После того как оружие полностью вынули из ножен, оно принимает свои обычные размеры.

**Мешочек десятины:** Это небольшой кошель из черного вельвета, перевязанный шелковой веревочкой. Любые монеты, драгоценные камни, все, что в него попадает, сразу переносится в церковь паладина, либо туда кому он должен отдавать десятину. Для этого необходимо иметь камешек, кусочек дерева, все что угодно, что связано с местом назначения. В противном случае его можно использовать, как просто кошель, но он может быть использован только законопослушно добрыми персонажами.

**Туника комфорта:** Эта легкая туника может быть одета поверх кольчуги, либо поверх любого доспеха, чей вес не равномерно распределяется по телу. Она идеально распределяет вес, за счет чего доспех начинает весить в два раза меньше, а персонаж не подвергается эффектам усталости. 



# Multiclassing 

## Extra Attack

You gain the Extra Attack class feature when you meet one of the following conditions:
•	You have five levels in the fighter class
•	You have eight combined levels in any classes that have the Extra Attack feature
Once you have Extra Attack, you don’t gain an additional Extra Attack unless you have eleven levels in the fighter class.

# How to Play

## Contests

A contest pits two or more characters or creatures against each other, with the outcome determined by each contender’s luck and talent. Contests are a form of ability check, except that instead of matching your roll against a DC, both you and the creature you are opposing make a roll. You then compare the two results to see who succeeds.

When to Have a Contest. Contests arise when two creatures attempt to do the same thing and only one can succeed, such as if both you and a bandit attempt to snatch up a magic ring that has fallen on the floor. In other cases, you might attempt something that another creature actively opposes. If you attempt to push open a door that an orc holds shut from the other side, you make an ability check to open the door, and the orc makes a check to keep it shut.

Resolving a Contest. A contest uses the same rules as an ability check, except that more than one creature makes a check. Any bonuses and penalties you apply when making an ability check that is not a contest also apply to contests involving that ability.
The creature with the higher check result wins the contest. The creature either succeeds at its action or prevents its opponent from succeeding.

If the contest ends in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant might win the contest by default. If you and a bandit tie in a contest to snatch a ring, neither one of you grabs it. If you tie in a contest to push open a door held shut by an orc, the door remains shut.

Likewise, if you tie in a contest to hide from another creature, your situation with respect to that creature does not change. If the creature was already aware of you before the contest, you fail to hide. If it was not aware of you before the contest, you remain hidden.

# DM Guidelines

## Resolving Tasks

In the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS® game, a Dungeon Master must take a number of roles, all at the same time. A DM serves as a referee, interpreting the rules and resolving any conflicts that arise because of them. The DM builds the world, creates adventures, and places monsters and treasure. The DM is the characters’ eyes and ears, describing what the characters can see and hear to the players.

The first rule of being a good DM is to remember that the rules are a tool that you and the players use to have a good time. The rules aren’t in charge. You, the DM, are the one in charge of the game. Guide the play experience and the use of the rules so that as many of your players have a good time as possible. There will be setbacks, such as a character being slain by an unlucky die roll, but look for ways to turn setbacks into interesting complications in the game’s story.

The second rule is to remember that the DM’s power comes with responsibility. Be fair and impartial with the players. Don’t force your story upon them or give them a game where their choices don’t matter. By the same token, challenge their characters with deadly monsters, fiendish traps, and vexing puzzles. A good DM is no pushover, but a good DM is also never simply out to slaughter the characters.

## When to Use Dice

Characters in the D&D game frequently attempt a tremendous variety of tasks, from running across a swinging rope bridge to talking their way out of a sticky spot with an orc chieftain. All these tasks are resolved in an interaction between you (the DM] and the player whose character is attempting the task.

When a player wants to take an action, it’s often appropriate to just let the action succeed. A character doesn’t normally need to make a Dexterity check to walk across an empty room, or a Charisma check to order a mug of ale in a tavern. Only call for a roll if you think it’s worth taking the time for the rules to come into the flow of the game. Ask yourself two questions to aid your decision.
Is the action being taken so easy, so free of stress or conflict, or so appropriate to the situation that there should be no chance of failure? “So easy” should take into account the ability score associated with the intended action. It’s easy for someone with a Strength score of 18 to flip over a table, though not easy for someone with a Strength score of 9.

Is the action being taken so inappropriate or impossible that it would never work? Hitting the moon with an arrow is, for instance, impossible in almost any circumstance.

If the answer to both of these questions is no, some kind of roll is appropriate.

# Exploration

## Hazards

Is there a chance that failing a task might lead to a disastrous outcome for the character? You decide whether a hazard applies to a particular ability check and when the hazard applies.

A hazard might affect a character who fails an ability check. For example, a character who attempts and fails a Strength (Athletics] check to jump across a pit that he or she couldn’t normally clear probably falls into the pit. Sometimes, though, a hazard kicks in only if the character misses the ability check’s DC (or loses a contest] by a significant margin, such as 5 or 10. Examples of hazards can be found in the “Tasks and Skills” section.

### Requirements

A task might require a specific tool or circumstance for a character to have any chance of success. For example, you might need a magnifying glass to accurately appraise a gem.

A character who cannot meet the requirements for a task automatically fails. One who meets them can attempt an ability check as normal for the task.

You can decide to waive this requirement, but the task should be hard to complete without it. You might give the character disadvantage on the ability check, or set the DC higher than you would for a character who met the requirement.

Otherwise, requirements should come up only rarely. Use them to encourage the players to come up with clever solutions, not to punish them for trying to do interesting things.

## Engaging the Players

As a DM, you could memorize these guidelines, apply them flawlessly, and still miss out on the point of D&D. Unlike some other games, D&D is a flexible set of guidelines, not a rigid set of laws.

When you ask a player to make an ability check, an attack, or a saving throw, you first should focus on engaging the players’ imaginations. Describe the scene to them, and pull in details such as sights, sounds, and even smells to make the action vivid.
More important, you want the players to become fully engaged in the game. Reward inventive players who look beyond game options to describe their characters’ actions. Roleplaying games stand out from other types of games because they allow for this type of creativity. Encourage it whenever you can.

The easiest way to do so is to make imaginative solutions the easiest path to success for the adventurers. Consider the following options.

**Ability Checks.** When a player makes an ability check, invite him or her to describe the character’s action. If the player makes clever use of the situation in the description, consider either granting an automatic success or advantage on the ability check.
Contests. In a contest, an ingenious description that points to a key advantage that a character might gain could lead you to grant the character advantage on the check.

**Attacks and Saving Throws.** A colorful description is nice for attacks and saving throws, but should rarely be the avenue to gaining a concrete game benefit, since it is too easy to abuse such an approach. You might have players endlessly describing how they resist a mind flayer’s mind blast or trying to narrate every detail of a sword blow. In most cases, spells and special abilities serve to grant characters advantage on their attacks and saving throws.

That said, if the situation warrants it, use advantage to grant a character an edge.

**Disadvantage.** Not every idea is a good one. A character might try to win the prince’s favor by bragging about all the bandits he or she slew, not realizing that the prince is an avowed pacifist. If an idea backfires on a player, apply disadvantage to the ability check or attack.## Multiple Ability Checks

Sometimes a character fails an ability check and wants to try again. You have a couple of options in this case.

In most cases, the character can simply try again. The only real cost is the time it takes. The character keeps trying and, after enough time passes, eventually succeeds. To speed things up, you can assume that a character can automatically succeed at a task if he or she spends twenty times the normal amount of time needed to complete it. This exception does not allow a character to turn an impossible task into a successful one.

In other cases, the first failure renders subsequent ability checks impossible. For instance, a rogue tries to trick a town guard into thinking that the group members are undercover agents of the king. The rogue loses the contest of Charisma (Deception] against Wisdom. The same lie told again clearly won’t work.

### Dungeon Adventuring


It should come as no surprise that dungeons, subterranean complexes of maze-like passages and chambers, play a key role in DUNGEONS & DRAGONS. Most adventures feature at least one dungeon, and it's possible to set a campaign entirely within an enormous, sprawling dungeon that can take characters from 1st to 20th level.

This section provides a turn-based system for exploring a dungeon. The rules address how to move through and investigate a dungeon, the tasks that characters can undertake while they explore, and how those tasks are performed.

Your Dungeon Map
Before the characters can explore your dungeon, you need to have a map that outlines its key geographic features and terrain.
A dungeon can range in size from a few chambers beneath a ruined temple to a huge complex of rooms and passages that extends hundreds of feet below the earth. It's best to use graph paper to map your dungeon, with each square on the paper representing an area of 10 feet by 10 feet.
You track the characters' movement on your map to determine what sort of obstacles and monsters they encounter. Your adventure notes should indicate the contents of key chambers and passages in the dungeon.
Light. Darkness might be the default condition inside an underground complex, but your dungeon can still have plenty of light sources. Most inhabited areas might be illuminated to some extent; even creatures that can see in the dark still use fire for warmth, cooking, and defense.
 
At the other end of the spectrum, many subterranean creatures, including undead, have no need for light, either because they have darkvision or because they don't rely on sight. In regions where these creatures operate, the characters must bring their own light sources.
Dungeon Features
At its most basic, a dungeon is composed of spaces that are enclosed by walls and separated from one another by doors and other barriers. It has other features, such as traps and portcullises, that further set it apart from aboveground adventuring environments.
Walls. The walls in a dungeon can be thick, natural stone formations or manufactured structures (usually wooden] built to subdivide large chambers.
Walls have hit points and can be destroyed. A creature can break through a 5-foot-square section of wall by succeeding on a Strength check with a DC equal to the wall's current hit points. The hit points and break DC for a section of wall are determined by its material and thickness.
Hit Points/Inch of Thickness
60
5
30
30
10
Doors. Intelligent dungeon inhabitants will barricade or lock doors when possible, especially if they expect attackers. The DC to break down a door depends on the materials used to create it. In addition, characters can attack doors in an attempt to batter them down. The Strength DC to break down a door equals its current hit points.
Door Material Hit Points
Adamantine	120
Glass	5
Iron	60
Stone	60
Wood	10
Portcullis. A portcullis is a set of vertical bars reinforced with one or two horizontal bands of iron. A portcullis is dropped to block a passage, 
with a winch and chain used to raise it back up. The big benefit provided by a portcullis is that it blocks a passage while still allowing guards to watch the area beyond and fire arrows or cast spells into it.
A portcullis can be lifted as an action that requires a DC 20 Strength check, or no check if a character can use that action to turn its winch. A creature that makes a DC 25 Strength check can bend the portcullis’s bars apart to allow creatures to pass through it.
Secret Doors. Some doors in a dungeon are crafted to blend into the walls that surround them. An Intelligence (Search] check is required to find clues pointing to the presence of a secret door. The DC is 10, 20, or 30, with higher DCs denoting better craftsmanship. A secret door that has been detected is treated like a normal door of the appropriate material (usually stone].
Traps. Intelligent dungeon dwellers set traps in areas where they expect enemies to approach, while long-forgotten tombs might have traps set hundreds of years ago.
The Dungeon Turn
This is the sequence of play for a minute of travel and exploration in a dungeon.
1.	Travel Pace and Exploration Tasks. The players decide what direction their characters will move in and their travel pace. They also decide on their exploration tasks, chosen from the list under “Exploration Tasks.” The players should also determine their formation (often called “marching order”]: who is in the front, the middle, and the back of the group.
2.	Progress on the Map. Follow the characters’ path on your dungeon map, describing what they see and allowing them to make decisions as they move. The characters might encounter creatures that you have placed in certain locations. If they do so, an interaction or combat encounter ensues.
3.	Random Encounters. Check for random encounters once every 10 minutes. If monsters are encountered, resolve any interaction or combat that occurs between the creatures and the characters.
After performing these steps, go back to the first step and repeat the sequence for another turn.

## Шаблон истории (приключения)

ВАЖНО! Для описания использовать наметки Александриана и Hack&Slash

Приключение - история с началом и концом, в которой протагонисты (персонажи игроков) стремятся достичь определенных целей, встречая сопротивление и/или проходя испытания. В конце концов протагонисты преуспевают в достижении целей или терпят поражение и приключение заканчивается.

Название

Обычно название приключению дается в конце создания приключения. Можно вообще не давать название если не придумывается.

Цели

Основные цели протагонистов.

Завязка

События, с которых начинается приключение. Здесь обычно прописывается получение задания от "квестодателя", или событие, которое запускает приключение (например нападение варваров на Мертвые снега)

Мотивация

Почему участники приключения заинтересованы в этом приключении? Мотивация состоит из двух частей
1) Мотивация персонажей. Почему персонажи захотят участвовать в этом приключении?
2) Мотивация игроков. Почему игроки захотят участвовать в этом приключении?

Кульминация

Это самая драматичная сцена приключения. Часто именно от нее зависит исход приключения и развязка.

Развязка

Итоги приключения. Лучше приводить несколько развязок в зависимости от того, насколько успешны персонажи.
Успех. Что происходит, если персонажи достигают целей приключения?
Провал. Что происходит, если персонажи не достигают целей приключения (погибают, отступают)

Цепь событий

Примерная цепь событий, которые будут происходить с персонажами в течение приключения. Пишется для того чтобы представить себе сюжет приключения и возможные точки для создания нелинейности.

Действующие лица

Здесь прописываются покровители протагонистов, антагонисты приключения, личный состав антагонистов, союзники, NPC и т.п.

Награды

Отдельно прописываются награды приключения. Отдельно, потому что награды можно получать не только после приключения, но и во время.

Конкретика

Карты, статблоки, сцены, энкаунтеры, опыт, игромеханика и т.п.

Сила - группа личностей, которая преследует определенные цели по определённым причинам. Отличие силы от фракции в первую очередь тем, что силы являются по умолчанию антагонистами или в лучшем случае безразличными к поселению Мертвых снегов и протагонистам (персонажам игроков).

Банда преступников, племя орков, клан варваров, армия гоблиноидов, шпионская ячейка, твердыня морозных великанов - это все силы.

## Замки и твердыни
 
Возможно, самая распространенная из разрушенных структур, которую можно найти на Ториле - разрушенный замок, выживший как символ королевских амбиций и владения землями. Замки и твердыни Фаэруна - обычно укрепленные здания с огромной физической защитой. Магическая защита также может присутствовать, если замок был в свое время занят способными заклинателями.
 
Разрушенные цитадели обычно занимают стратегическое положение. Как и крепости, они содержали гарнизоны отрядов и арсеналы, заполненные оружием, и иногда служили для сохранения магических артефактов и религиозных реликвий. Некоторые замки также получили известность или славу из-за размещения военных, религиозных и монашеских орденов.

## Экстрапространственные места
 
Заклинатели различных утерянных империй создавали постоянные экстрапространственные места и демипланы, служившие им домами, санктуариями, тюрьмами и складами, и многие из них существуют и по сей день.

91-100Склеп
 
## Башни
 
Разрушенные магические башни рассеяны по всей длине и ширине Фаэруна. Некоторые далеки от цивилизованных областей, другие стоят посреди городов и городков. Будь это шпиль волшебника, магический университет или палата призывания, скрытая глубоко под землей - такая башня, как правило, принадлежала магу великой силы, который использовал ее как дом, библиотеку и лабораторию. Ныне покинутые, эти башни соблазняют любопытных слухами о забытых магических методах, таинственных заклинаниях и изделиях великой силы.
 
Магические башни обеспечивают богатство приключенческих возможностей для тех, кто ищет магической силы и знаний, но опытные авантюристы предпочитают знать, а не предполагать, что владелец покинутой башни мертв. Чрезвычайно мощные волшебники и колдуны, путешествующие на другие планы или даже в другие миры, могут проводить столетия далеко от Торила, но все же башни редко остаются незащищенными. Некоторые такие структуры имеют сигналы тревоги, уведомляющие их владельцев в случае вторжения, а некоторые могут призывать своих владельцев из других измерений, если возникнет такая потребность.
 
Кроме того, некоторые башни, которые кажутся пустынными, не покинуты действительно — их древние владельцы остаются внутри как личи, демиличи или спектральные маги.

# Rumors

In addition to the constant threat posed by the numerous monsters of the Savage Frontier, more insidious perils are manifesting. The Zhentarim seek to extend their influence westward from Llorkh. The Kraken Society, an organization of spies, assassins, and sinister dealers in lore and knowledge, is well ensconced in Luskan and other coastal cities and dreams of subverting inland towns such as Yartar along the Dessarin valley. And the Arcane Brotherhood of Luskan contests the influence of Waterdeep's Lords over the region.
Adventurers come to the Silver Marches to advance the cause of civilization by scouring the land for monster lairs, cleansing dangerous ruins, and driving orc raiders back to their mountain dens. Silverymoon's growth and prosperity have brought new enemies though - the merchants and proud lords of cities such as Luskan and Yartar who grow jealous of the riches that flow through the Silver Marches.

Barbaric Justice: An Uthgardt barbarian of the Black Lion tribe flees into the arms of an adventuring company on the road, pursued by a small party of warriors determined to hunt him down. The fugitive, a young hunter named Thurvald, claims that he is accused of a crime he did not commit, the murder of the shaman Bogohardt at Beorunna's WelL The pursuers, of course, say he's guilty.

If the heroes choose to protect Thurvald, the hunters are out matched by the party and can be driven off with a hard fight. They return in greater force later and trail Thuvald and the heroes wherever they go, even into the city of Silverymoon.

The heroes can simply turn over Thurvald to his pursuers ... but he really is innocent. Thurvald is a shapechanger (a snow leopard), a secret suspected by his tribe and known to the People of the Black Blood. Malar's cultists tried and failed to recruit Thurvald of his own free will, so they murdered the tribal shaman and framed Thurvald. They plan to let the Black Lion tribe inflict its harsh justice on Thurvald and then rescue him before he is killed.

Thurvald knows he was framed and knows the two Malar worshipers are responsible. To prove Thurvald's innocence, the heroes must track down the real murderers and expose their guilt.

Giant Opportunities: Taern Horn blade, the new High Mage of Silverymoon, perceives the arrival of the giants in the Evermoors as a chance to pacify the Silver Marches' western border. Silverymoon seeks agents to enter the Moors, identify and contact the most lawful and powerful giants of the area, and attempt to form an alliance to reduce the giants' threat to Silverymoon and Nesme to the west.

Dark Deeds in Ascore: The ruined dwarven city of Ascore on the border of Anauroch was once the gateway to the realm of Deizoun, a rich seaport on the long-vanished Narrow Sea. An expedition from the City of Shade has set up a temporary camp in the ruins, driving off any adventurers who come to explore the old dwarven city. A survivor from one of these adventuring companies reports that a mighty archmage leads the shade effort, which seems to be centered around a strange pool of liquid shadow surrounded by thirteen odd, pyramid-like structures. What are the shades up to? What might they unleash in their efforts to achieve their objective?

Missing Emissary: Two tendays ago, a wizard escorted by four Everlund rangers went into the High Forest to speak with Turlang about the trees' advance upon Everlund's walls. All contact with the wizard has been lost, though divination spells indicate that the wizard, at least, is still alive. Did the wizard pay the price for delivering bad news to Turlang, or did she fall prey to one of the forest's other perils?

Tribes of the Silver Marches

Black Lion: The Black Lions fear their ancestor mound (Beorunna's Well) as much as they revere it, and perhaps moreso. They do not post guards at Beorunna's Well itself, but rather leave that task to the Red Tiger tribe.

Black Raven: The Black Raven tribe appoints an honor guard of no less than ten warriors (CN human Bbn2) and the same number of giant ravens to remain at Raven Rock at all times. The guardians watch over not only the tribe's ancestor mound, but its sacrificial treasure shrine as well.

Gray Wolf: The Gray Wolf tribe no longer participates in helping the Black Ravens guard Raven Rock.

Red Tiger: Protecting the ancestor mound at Beorunna's Well is a task appointed for the Red Tiger's young members who are about to take their tribal vows. At any given time, three to six young men and women (CG human War1) are guided by a tribal cleric (CN human Clr4 of Uthgar).

Sky Pony: The Sky Pony tribe considers it an honor and a sacred duty to provide a constant guard for its ancestor mound. It considers the watch more ceremonial than practical, however. A trio of tribal warriors (CN human Bbn1) is always on guard at One Stone.

Black Lion: The Black Lions fear their ancestor mound (Beorunna's Well) as much as they revere it, and perhaps moreso. They do not post guards at Beorunna's Well itself, but rather leave that task to the Red Tiger tribe.

Black Raven: The Black Raven tribe appoints an honor guard of no less than ten warriors (CN human Bbn2) and the same number of giant ravens to remain at Raven Rock at all times. The guardians watch over not only the tribe's ancestor mound, but its sacrificial treasure shrine as well.

Ghaurin's Hold что под Wildlands Rest содержит бессметные сокровища

"Tell Us Who to Hate": The centaurs of the High Forest have received multiple divinations telling them that they must win a war in the next month or lose their tribe's luck. The divinations specified that the centaurs cannot declare the war themselves -- they have to be told who to war against by a non-centaur who happens to be a member of a PC race. After the PC obliges, the centaurs reveal the second part of the prophecy: The noncentaur who names their enemy must lead them into battle. If the PCs avoid doing their prophetic duty, make sure that the non-centaur NPC who names an enemy picks a group the PCs are friendly with.

The Latest from Silverymoon: Alustriel of the Seven Sisters, the ruler of Silverymoon for 134 years until she stepped down to oversee all the Silver March, encourages stronger bonds between the diverse races of Silverymoon. Marriage and children between the races are still relatively rare, but child-rearing, education, and professional training are often so intermingled that outsiders think of Silverymoon as the place where elves think they're dwarves, dwarves think they're elves, and humans think they're everything.

Tag in the Woods: Giants from the Evermoors chase a small army of orcs out of the moors into the Moonwood. While the orcs play the mice to the giants' dire cats, the giants begin to realize that they like it here. Not many folks around. Lots of big trees. Warmer than the moor. Nice place to live. The giants may hate orcs, but that doesn't make them nice giants, so the PCs need to dissuade them before they get too comfortable in their "new home."

Many ruins in Old Delzoun contained lost portals to the Underdark. Underdark denizens sometimes used these portals during surface raids.

In Silverymoon it is joked that Quaervarr is valuable in the alliance just to preserve its fine inn, the Whistling Stag.

Tavern tales told of a small coffer of coins once found behind a loose stone in the cellar wall. As a result of this persistent rumor, every part of the cellar was excavated multiple times by treasure seekers, but nothing was ever found. The Harpers rebuilt the cellar after each act of vandalism, which gave rise to another rumor about the cellar being haunted or magical.

## Common Themes & Conflicts
The Orcs vs. Everybody
 
The orcs in the North wage a constant war of raid and retreat on frontier out¬posts. Small wandering bands constantly harry farms and villages, stealing live¬stock and brutally killing people. Just as often, they take slaves. Attempts to nego¬tiate or control them for any length of time end in failure. Bounties placed on orcish heads only seem to encourage the beasts to attack for sport.
 
The Luskan/Ruathym War
 
The status of this conflict depends on when the DM begins the campaign. Dur¬ing the Year of the Prince, these two are waging bloodthirsty war upon on one another, with Ruathym getting the worst of it. Shiploads of Luskan raiders plunder and pillage the Ruathym coast and slay their leader.
 
During the Year of Shadows, Water- deep forces a truce and ends the conflict. In so doing, an alliance, the Captains' Con-federation, is forged between the Luskanites and the island kingdoms.
 
Con¬federation warriors raid cities along the Sword Coast in huge numbers and no ship at sea is safe from Northmen pirates. The Year of Shadows ends with the Lords of Waterdeep in council, deciding wheth¬er to declare war or not.
 
The Uthgardt Barbarians vs. Civi¬lization
 
The average Uthgardt regards civiliza¬tion as a cancer to be cut out. Most tribes regularly raid civilized settle¬ments, slaying domesticated animals, burning buildings, and crushing crops. Captives become slaves, though young¬sters are often adopted into the tribe if they seem sturdy enough.
 
The Uthgardt vs. the Orcs
 
This is a holy war. Its roots date back to the formation of the Uthgardt as a peo¬ple. The barbarians and the orcs com¬pete directly with one another for the same resources. Savage humans and bloodthirsty orcs fight to the death upon meeting. Adventurers in the North could do worse than to aid the Uthgardt in such a conflict.
 
Monsters vs. Humans
 
The monsters of the North, including the trolls of the Evermoors, treat humans — civilized and barbarian alike —as fruit ripe for the picking. There are always giants who raid villag¬es, foul creatures who wake hungry and leave their lairs to feast on a village, dragons who crave treasure, vampires with unholy thirsts, and more.
 
 
Pirates vs. Merchants
 
Piracy is an accepted fact of life in the northern Trackless Sea. Pirates attack ships along the Sword Coast from Ches (March) until Uktar (November). Most are Northmen, but about a third hail from southern lands.
 
Hellgate Keep vs. Mankind
The demonic forces of Hellgate Keep continually press against the human and dwarven folk in the northeast. Men have not been able to drive the demons out, but mercenary companies and adventuring bands can always find employ as guardians in Turnstone Pass. A monastery of Helm, near Neverwin- ter, sponsors a company of 100 troops of all character classes each year. This group, called Helm's Hundred, leaves Helm's Hold each spring for Sundabar.




# Wilderness Adventuring

Sometimes in a D&D adventure, travel through the wilderness is purely a matter of description. Players describe where their characters are headed, and you narrate what happens on the way. At other times, the journey is as important to the adventure as its destination, and wilderness exploration rules will come into play.

This section provides a turn-based system for traveling outdoors. The rules address how to move through and investigate a wilderness area, and they discuss environmental considerations such as weather and high altitude.

An optional section has rules that cover tasks characters can undertake while exploring in the outdoors, and how those tasks are performed, plus a system for determining what happens if the characters get lost in the wilderness.

Your Outdoor Map

Before the characters can explore a wilderness or other outdoor area, you need to have a map that outlines its key geographic features and terrain.

The outdoor environment you’re mapping might be an expanse of wilderness on the surface of the world or a vast subterranean location, such as the great caverns and passages of the Underdark. Either way, it’s better to use a hex grid than a square grid for mapping, because a hex grid enables more precise calculation of the distance between two points.

The scale of your outdoor map depends on how much detail you want. For the most detailed areas, each hex or square represents 1 mile. To cover larger areas, each hex or square represents 6 miles. Your largest scale maps, those covering massive areas, should cover 36 miles per hex or square.

Just as you would do in a dungeon, track the characters’ movement on your outdoor map to determine what sort of terrain they encounter, monster lairs, settlements, or other noteworthy features they might stumble across. To keep things simple, assume that the characters find a noteworthy location when they enter its hex or square, unless the site is specifically hidden. The characters might not walk directly up to the front door of a ruined castle in the 1-mile-wide hex they just entered, but they can find old paths, outlying ruins, and such signs of its presence in the area with ease.

**Visibility.** When traveling outdoors, characters can see about 2 miles in any direction on a clear day, assuming that trees, hills, and other obstructions don’t block their view. Rain cuts visibility down to 1 mile, and fog cuts it down to a few hundred feet.
Multiply the distance the characters can see by 20 if they are atop a mountain or a tall hill, or are otherwise able to look down upon the area around them from a lofty height.

## Terrain

Outdoor terrain is represented by a few general categories that describe how difficult it is to travel through an area of that terrain and (in the optional rules] find food and water.

For the purpose of travel, terrain is either normal, difficult or very difficult, with difficult terrain cutting the characters’ speed by one third, and very difficult terraint - by two third while they travel through it

If the characters travel by a road or path, they move at their normal speed regardless of the terrain around them.

TERRAIN SUMMARY | Type Travel
Desert | Normal
Forest	| Difficult
Hills	| Normal
Jungle	| Very Difficult
Mountains	| Very Difficult
Plains	| Normal
Road/Path	| Normal
Swamp	| Very Difficult
Tundra	| Normal

## The Wilderness Turn

This is the sequence of play for an hour of travel and exploration in a wilderness environment.

**1.	Direction and Pace.** The players decide what direction their characters will move in and their travel pace. The players should also determine their formation: who is in the front, the middle, and the back of the group. (If you’re using the optional rules, they also decide on their exploration tasks at this time.]

**2.	Progress on the Map.** Determine the distance and the direction the characters traveled, taking into account their travel pace and chosen path.

**3.	Random Encounters.** Check for a random encounter and, if one is indicated, resolve any interaction or combat that occurs between the creatures and the characters.

**4.	Environmental Effects.** Apply effects of the environment, weather, or terrain, such as extreme cold. Some of these effects might require saving throws from the characters. In addition, if the characters attempt a forced march, resolve saving throws for that activity at this point.

If exploration continues, go back to the first step and repeat the sequence for another turn.

## Travel Pace

The travel pace that the characters choose—fast, moderate, or slow—determines the chance that monsters and other threats surprise them, how much distance they can cover during an hour of movement, and (in the optional rules] what tasks they can perform as they travel.

Explain to the players what their choices are. Do they want to get through the next area quickly, without much care for possible dangers, or are they determined to move slowly and keep a close watch for anything along their path? When the group decides on a travel pace, use the line on the Travel Pace table that corresponds to their intent. If the party splits up, each smaller group chooses its own pace.

The travel pace of an exploring group determines its readiness. This quality is expressed as a DC that you can use for several circumstances, such as when a character makes a Wisdom saving throw at the start of a battle to avoid being surprised or (in the optional rules] when the characters are in danger of becoming lost.

Travel pace also determines the greatest distance a group can cover during an hour, as shown on the table. Difficult terrain, including forests, mountains, jungles, and swamps reduces travel speed by half. For example, a group moving at a moderate pace through a forest can expect to traverse no more than 1 mile every hour.

Travel Pace | Distance traveled by minute | Speed per hour | Distance per day | | Pace Readiness DC | Special
--------|--------|--------|--------|--------
Very  Fast | tbd | tbd | tbd | tbd | tbd
Fast | 400 f | 4 m | 30 m | 20 | -5 penalty to passive Wisdom (Perception) scores
Normal | 300 f | 3 m | 24 m | 15 | Passive Perception 
Slow | 200 f | 2 m | 18 m | 10 | able to use stealth, Passice Perception or roll Perception - choose max
Very slow | tbd | 1 m | 12 m | 10| tbd

**Mounts and Vehicles.** For short spans of time (up to an hour), many animals move much faster than humanoids. A mounted character can ride at a gallop for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, characters can cover larger distances at this pace, but this is very rare except in densely populated areas.

Characters in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose a pace as normal. Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessels, and they don't suffer penalties for a fast pace or gain benefits from a slow pace. Depending on the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be able to travel for up to 24 hours per day.

Certain special mounts, such as a pegasus or griffon, or special vehicles, such as a carpet of flying, allow you to travel more swiftly. The Dungeon Master's Guide contains more information on special methods of travel.

**Activity While Traveling**

As adventurers travel through a dungeon or the wilderness, they need to remain alert for danger, and some characters might perform other tasks to help the group's journey.

### Marching Order

The adventurers should establish a marching order.

A marching order makes it easier to determine which characters are affected by traps, which ones can spot hidden enemies, and which ones are the closest to those enemies when a fight breaks out.

A character might occupy the front rank, one or more middle ranks, or the back rank. Characters in the front and back ranks need enough room to travel side by side with others in their rank. When space is too tight, the marching order must change, usually by moving characters to a middle rank.

**Fewer Than Three Ranks.** If an adventuring party arranges its marching order with only two ranks, they are a front rank and a back rank. If there's only one rank, it's considered a front rank.

**For party roster**

Front rank

Middle rank

Rear rank

## Random Encounters

You check at the end of each hour to see whether someone or something inadvertently crosses the adventurers’ path, or vice versa.
The population density of the region determines the likelihood of coming across monsters (see the table]. To check for wandering monsters, roll a d20. If an encounter occurs, roll on the appropriate wandering monster table to determine what the heroes meet. (This table might be one of your devising, or it might be provided inside the adventure you’re running.]

Note that the nature of random encounters depends on the region the characters are exploring. On a civilized road, they are more likely to encounter a wandering tinker or a caravan than a band of monsters.
 
Region | Encounter Chance (d20)
----------|--------------
Sparsely inhabited | 20
Densely inhabited | 18-20
Typical region  | 18-20

## Encountering Creatures

If an exploring group encounters creatures (which might be wandering monsters or might be specific participants in the adventure], the characters can try to attack them, avoid them, or interact with them in some other way.

Alertness	| Readiness DC
--------|----------
Low	| 20
Normal	| 10
High	| 5

## Encounter Distance

Typically, the terrain or layout of an area determines how far the characters are from creatures when the groups become aware of each other. If this distance isn’t predetermined, roll a d20 + 20. Multiply that result by 10 if the area is in normal terrain (such as a grassy field, barren tundra, or a frozen lake] or by 5 if the terrain is difficult (such as rolling hills, or a forest]. The resulting number is the distance in feet between the two groups at the start of their encounter.


Terrain	| Encounter Distance
--------------|---------------------
Arctic, desert, farmland, or grassland | 6d6 × 10 feet
Forest, swamp, or woodland	| 2d8 × 10 feet
Hills or wastelands	| 2d10 × 10 feet
Jungle	| 2d6 × 10 feet
Mountains	| 4d10 × 10 feet
**Audible Distance**
Trying to be quiet | 2d6 × 5 feet
Normal noise level | 2d6 × 10 feet
Very loud	| 2d6 × 50 feet
**Visibility Outdoors**
Clear day, no obstructions | 2 miles
Rain | 1 mile
Fog	| 100 to 300 feet
From a height	| × 20


### Stealth

Before asking the players what they want to do, determine if either group notices the other. One group or the other can avoid detection completely only if all its members are sneaking. Otherwise, contests occur as necessary to determine if anyone sneaking on either side is detected.

### Surprise

If one group is hidden from the other, that group has surprise, as described in the combat rules. Otherwise, each creature and character makes a Wisdom saving throw against a DC that corresponds to its readiness. The readiness DC for characters is determined by their travel pace. For monsters, it depends on their degree of alertness, as shown below.

## Finding Locations and Objects

When the characters come across a location or an object of special note during the performance of their tasks, describe the discovery to them and allow them to take actions as appropriate.

## Weather

In addition to the risk of encountering creatures or stumbling across a strange location, the characters also face mundane weather threats such as heavy rain, freezing cold, or searing heat.

You can pick weather to fit your campaign or roll on the following tables to determine the weather for a given day. Use the table that corresponds to the current season of the year (assuming the region has a temperate climate]. The tables include one for each of the four seasons found in temperate regions, plus two more for exceptionally hot and cold environments such as desert and tundra. You can also use these tables to account for the geography or altitude of a region or area. For instance, the upper heights of a mountain range will be cold and snowy even in a warm climate.

**Temperate Spring/Fall**

No special weather | Storm (light rain) | Storm (heavy rain)

Temperate | Winter	Weather (d20)

Cold	| 1-14

Cold, storm (snow)	| 18-20

Cold, storm (heavy snow) | 16-20

**Temperate Summer**

No special weather Hot

Storm (heavy rain)

**Desert**

Hot

Hot, storm (dust)

Storm (heavy rain)

**Tundra**

Cold

Cold, storm (snow)

Cold, storm (heavy snow)

### Cold Weather

While the temperature is below 0 degrees Fahrenheit, characters exposed to the cold must make DC 10 Constitution saves at the end of each hour. Characters without cold weather gear, such as thick coats, gloves, and so on, automatically fail this save.

On a failed saving throw, a character gains a level of exhaustion.

### Storm

Bad weather, such as snow, rain, powerful winds, dust storms, and other hazards, reduces travel speeds by half, quartering speed in total when combined with difficult terrain.

In addition, specific types of storms have the following additional effects.

**Dust Storm**. Visibility is reduced to 50 feet, and creatures suffer disadvantage on saves to avoid becoming surprised.

**Heavy Rain**. Visibility is reduced to 50 feet, and creatures suffer disadvantage on saves to avoid becoming surprised.

**Heavy Snow**. Visibility is reduced to 50 feet, and creatures suffer disadvantage on saves to avoid becoming surprised. Heavy snow continues to reduce speed as described above for 1d6 days after the storm.

### Hot Weather

In exceptionally hot weather (at or above 100 degrees Fahrenheit], characters exposed to the heat must make DC 10 Constitution saves at the end of each hour. Characters wearing medium or heavy armor or otherwise clad in heavy clothing suffer disadvantage on this save.
On a failed saving throw, a character gains a level of exhaustion.

### High Altitude

Traveling at altitudes above 10,000 feet is particularly taxing due to the lack of oxygen in the air. Each hour spent traveling counts as two hours for purposes of determining how long characters can travel.

Exhausted characters cannot rest to reduce their exhaustion while above 10,000 feet.

Characters and creature can become acclimated to high altitude. Doing so requires spending many months at this elevation. Creatures cannot become acclimated to elevations above 20,000 feet. 

Creatures that do not need to breathe, such as undead creatures or constructs, suffer no ill effects from high altitude.

## Food and Water

In the wilderness, carrying enough food and water to survive is critical to survival. Characters who run short of either suffer the effects of exhaustion.

### Water

A character consumes one gallon of water per day, or two gallons each day if the weather is hot. A character who has only half that much water available must make a DC 10 Constitution save or suffer a level of exhaustion at the end of the day. A character with access to even less water suffers one automatic level of exhaustion that day.

If the character already has one or more levels of exhaustion, the character takes two levels in either case.

### Food

A one day supply of food is about equivalent to one pound of supplies. A character can go 3 + Constitution modifier days without food. If a character eats half a pound of food, that counts as going half a day without food. A normal day of eating resets the count of days without food to zero.

After that time period, a character automatically suffers a level of exhaustion for each day without food, or must make a DC Constitution save or take a level of exhaustion for each day of eating half a pound of food.

## Food and Creature Size

The rules for food and water assume that the characters are size Medium. Creatures of different sizes, including non-humanoids such as horses, need different amounts of sustenance.

Small creatures consume half as much food and water.

Large creatures consumer four times as much.

Huge creatures require sixteen times as much.

Gargantuan needs 32 times the supplies.

Colossal require 64 times as much food and water.

## Optional Wilderness Exploration Rules

The basic exploration rules cover all the basic movements of managing a journey from one place to the next. The following, optional rules add more detail and realism to the process by introducing specific tasks that the characters can take while traveling. They are especially useful for when the characters travel into the deep wilderness, far from any civilized lands.

### Exploration Tasks

An exploration task is a duty a character assumes for the duration of an exploration turn, a duty that usually contributes to the group's overall disposition and preparedness. Characters choose their tasks during the first step of an exploration turn.

After the group has agreed on its pace, explain to the players what their choices are for exploration tasks and ask what task each character will undertake. When a party is traveling at a fast pace, there's no time for characters to perform any of these tasks.
When each character has chosen a task, have the players roll ability checks to determine the outcome of their characters' tasks, then resolve any situations that arise from the success or failure of those checks.

A character can perform up to two tasks during an exploration turn, but dividing one's attention and energy is risky. If a character takes two actions, any ability checks associated with those actions have disadvantage.

Activities that require an action during a combat round, such as casting a spell, don’t count as exploration tasks. There’s no hard limit on the number of such activities a character can perform.

#### Foraging

**PHB:** The character can keep an eye out for ready sources of food and water, making a Wisdom (Survival) check when the DM calls for it. (The Dungeon Master's Guide has rules for foraging.)

The characters can gather food and water as they travel, especially if they are running low on supplies. When a character chooses this task, the character makes a single Wisdom (Survival] check with a DC determined by the abundance of food and water in the region. If the check succeeds, that character finds a quantity of pounds of food and gallons of water equal to the 1d6 + the character's Wisdom modifier.

If multiple characters choose this task, they each make separate ability checks. More characters foraging can find food to feed more people.

FORAGING DCS

Terrain	| DC
--------|-------
Abundant	| 10
Average	| 15
Desolate	| 20

**Characters who turn their attention to other tasks as the group travels are not focused on watching for danger. These characters don't contribute their passive Wisdom (Perception) scores to the group's chance of noticing hidden threats.**


Foraging DCs

Food and Water Availability	DC
Abundant food and water sources	10
Limited food and water sources	15
Very little, if any, food and water sources	20

If multiple characters forage, each character makes a separate check. A foraging character finds nothing on a failed check. On a successful check, roll 1d6 + the character's Wisdom modifier to determine how much food (in pounds) the character finds, then repeat the roll for water (in gallons).

Food and Water
p111
The food and water requirements noted in the Player's Handbook are for characters. Horses and other creatures require different quantities of food and water per day based on their size. Water needs are doubled if the weather is hot.

Food and Water Needs
Creature Size	Food per Day	Water per Day
Tiny	1/4 pound	1/4 gallon
Small	1 pound	1 gallon
Medium	1 pound	1 gallon
Large	4 pounds	4 gallons
Huge	16 pounds	16 gallons
Gargantuan	64 pounds	64 gallons

#### Keeping Watch

It helps to keep an eye and an ear open for danger. When a character chooses keeping watch as an exploration task, the character makes a single Wisdom (Perception] check to detect hidden creatures and an Intelligence (Search] check to detect hidden objects as the group travels during the current exploration turn. A character’s check result is used to contest the checks of any creatures that are attempting to hide from the explorers. If someone keeping watch detects a creature, it cannot surprise the group.

#### Mapmaking

**PHB:** Draw a Map. The character can draw a map that records the group's progress and helps the characters get back on course if they get lost. No ability check is required.

Making an accurate map is vital to ensuring that explorers have the best sense of their surroundings. It can also help keep them from becoming lost.

When a character chooses mapmaking as an exploration task, the character must have a writing instrument and some surface (such as paper or parchment] on which to record the map.

The map a character creates might be similar to your actual map of the area, but not as complete. When you give out information to a player whose character is mapping, restrict that information to only what the character would perceive while “actually” performing the task.

If more than one character chooses this task, those who do so simply create multiple maps of the area. (This strategy can prove useful if one character’s map is lost or destroyed later in the adventure.]

**Characters who turn their attention to other tasks as the group travels are not focused on watching for danger. These characters don't contribute their passive Wisdom (Perception) scores to the group's chance of noticing hidden threats.**


#### Track

**PHB:** A character can follow the tracks of another creature, making a Wisdom (Survival) check when the DM calls for it. (The Dungeon Master's Guide has rules for tracking.)  

#### Navigating



Traveling in the wilderness or a large, unfamiliar city carries the risk of becoming lost. A character can reduce this risk by navigating for the group, keeping a careful eye out for landmarks and the position of the sun, the moon, and stars.
When a character chooses navigating as an exploration task, the character makes a single Wisdom (Survival] check to prevent the group from losing its way during the current exploration turn. If more than one member of the group chooses this task, each navigator makes a check, and you use the best result to determine if the group becomes lost.

**Characters who turn their attention to other tasks as the group travels are not focused on watching for danger. These characters don't contribute their passive Wisdom (Perception) scores to the group's chance of noticing hidden threats.**

#### Sneaking

Keeping a low profile is often the best option in a dangerous area. When a character chooses sneaking as an exploration task, the character makes a single Dexterity (Stealth] check to hide as the group travels. Anyone who chooses this task has advantage on this check if the group’s travel pace is slow. To notice a sneaking character, a creature must contest the character’s check, using Wisdom (Perception] or Intelligence (iNVESTIGATION], and win.x`

#### Improvised Tasks

A character might think of some way to contribute to an exploring group that isn't covered by the tasks described here. If so, you can allow the use of an improvised exploration task, but only if its performance requires no more than one-third of the time encompassed by an exploration turn. Also, as with other tasks, a character can't perform an improvised task if the group's travel pace is fast.

### CAMPING

Characters can carry a tent to protect themselves against wind and rain, but sometimes they don't have access to that kind of gear, and in those situations they can try to find a natural shelter or build one using materials they can gather. 

**Natural shelters** are divided in two types: basic and advanced 

**Basic Shelter.** Almost every natural shelter found in the wild is considered as a basic shelter. This shelter has enough space for 4 medium-sized creatures, and in general they're constructed from many small pieces of vegetation. Due to its simple design, a basic shelter protects against wind or precipitation (determined by the DM)

**Advanced Shelter.** An advanced shelter have space for 6 medium-sized creatures or more and protects everyone inside against the wind rain, snow and other environmental features. Additionally, an advanced shelter helps to maintain the personal temperature and in some cases it also provides some defenses against wild creatures.

### Условия для нормального отдыха

Базовые условия: температура от 10 до 30 град, без дождя - спальник

#### NATURAL SHELTERS

Terrain and time are the mayor factors that determines the chance for adventurers to be able to locate a natural shelter or construct something out of materials they find the zone.

Arctic zones has no useful vegetation that adventurers can use for shelter, but they can find crevasses and make improvised snow walls that can provide some protection.

Desert zones has no vegetation that adventurers can use, but they can run across irregularities in the surface, such as large rocks and some dunes that can provide shelter on at least one side.

Forest zones are one of the easiest terrains to find natural shelter. Trees and large plants can give adventurers some protection from wind and rain. In a forest, boughs or branches can be cut from trees and laid across a grid of poles to give characters a roof over their heads and protection from wind mils are full of irregular terrain that can serve as a simple windbreak. Additionally, thick vegetation is fairly abundant during most of the year, allowing adventurers to fashion a windbreak out of it.

Mountains, for this purpose, are considered to be rough, rocky areas with little or no vegetation. However, adventurers can come across some natural features, such as caves and alcoves that are large enough for the group.

Plains are generally flat, but not necessarily featureless. A small gully might help adventurers to get out of the wind Additionally, if a plain has some vegetation, characters may be able to gather enough branches and greenery for a windbreak.

Swamps commonly have vegetation that can be scavenged and used as shelter, and characters can come across a fallen tree or similar feature that can help as a shelter.

#### FINDING NATURAL SHELTER

Characters can make a Wisdom (Survival) check to try to find a natural shelter in the area. Depending on the terrain, the difficulty and time to find an appropriate shelter varies, as shown in the following table.

Terrain	| DC | Time Needed
--------|--------|--------
Arctic | 25 |	30 minutes
Desert | 25 | 30 minutes
Forest | 1O | 10 minutes
Hills | 1O | 10 minutes
Mountains | 20 | 20 minutes
Plains | 20 | 20 minutes
Swamps | 15 | 15 minutes

##$# ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS

You can increase the DC and time depending on some special conditions, such as looking for a shelter in the night or while it's raining.

*	Rain, fog and low visibility areas. Increase the DC by 3 and add half the base time.

*	Storm, snowfall and no visibility areas. Increase the DC by 5 and it takes twice the base time.

### UPGRADING A SHELTER

While characters can look for natural shelter, they can also gather materials and upgrade a basic shelter into an advanced shelter or add extra features, such as a palisade wall or other defensive measures.

### COLLECTING MATERIALS

A character can gather materials by making an Wisdom (Survival) check or a Strength (Athletics) check. Use the table under the Finding Natural Shelter part to determine the DC and time used for collecting materials. During this activity, the character gather branches and vegetation that is lying in the area, cut down a tree to collect wood or mine a big rock to collect stones. 
On a success, it collects a number of units equal to 2d6 + its Constitution modifier. A character can make a number of checks per day equal to twice its Constitution modifier (minimum 1)

### UPGRADING

For upgrading a shelter, the character must use a number of units of materials depending on which feature they want, as shown in the table below. Multiple characters can combine their efforts toward the upgrading of the shelter, reducing the time by ten times its Constitution modifier for each character working on the upgrade to a minimum of 10 minutes. For example, a character with a Constitution modifier of +2 will reduce the time it takes to finish a shelter feature by 20 minutes.

Feature	| Units Required | Time
--------|--------|--------
Advanced shelter upgrade | 15 | 4 hours
Basic wall | 6 | 1 hour
Platform | 10 | 2 hours
Spike barrier | 5 | 30 minutes
Stone wall | 10 | 4 hours

**Advanced Shelter Upgrade.** Upgrading a basic shelter into an advanced shelter includes a door, simple roofing and walls made from various pieces of thatch, wood, stone or similar. Upgrading a shelter allows up to 6 medium-sized creatures to enter and protect themselves.

**Basic Wall** This 15-feet long, 6 feet tall fence or wall is made from wooden stakes, tree trunks, adobe or even bones, and it’s used as a defensive structure or enclosure. Each 5 feet of wall has an AC 15,15 hit points and a damage threshold of
**Platform.** This 10-foot square wooden platform is attached on a large tree, or raised on piles over the soil enabling to build on it. The platform can be built up to 10 feet high and includes a simple wooden staircase to access the platform.
**Spike barrier.** A 10-feet long barrier with many wooden or bone spikes. The area covered by the barrier is considered difficult terrain. Any creature that moves through the spike wall must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 10) or take ld4 piercing damage. The barrier has an AC 15,15 hit points and a damage threshold of 5.
**Stone Wall** A stone wall is a 15-feet long, 6 feet tall wall made from brick-and-mortar, used as a defensive structure or enclosure. Each 5 feet of wall has an AC 17, 30 hit points and a damage threshold of 10.

Some of this upgrades might not available to build in certain terrains due the type of materials needed For example, a spike barrier might be hard to craft in a desert since it requires wood or large bones.

#### ADDITIONAL FEATURES
While the upgrading features covers the most basic and generic ones, you can also create new ones, such as a clay oven, wooden furniture and such for creating a survival-themed campaign.


## Getting Lost

The characters might become lost. Explorers who are following a road or some other form of path or trail can’t become lost in normal circumstances.

If the characters might become lost, make note of the Wisdom (Survival] check result of any character who chose navigating during the current exploration turn (or the highest result, if more than one character performed this task]. If no one did so, treat the check result as 0. The DC for this check corresponds to the readiness of the group, as determined by its travel pace, plus a modifier based on the terrain (see the table].

If any character performed mapmaking as a task during the current exploration turn, the DC is reduced by 5.

Terrain	| DC Modifier
---------|--------------
Forest, swamp, jungle, mountains	| +5
Light forest jungle, hills, desert, tundra	| 0
Plains, prairie	| -5

Success. If the navigator’s Wisdom (Survival] check succeeds, the characters successfully travel the distance and in the direction they want.

Failure. If the check fails, the characters inadvertently travel in the wrong direction. Halfway through their travel in the current turn, you roll a d4 to determine how the group has deviated from its intended course.

d4 | Deviation
------|------
1	| 90 degrees left
2	| 45 degrees left
3	| 45 degrees right
4	| 90 degrees right


For example, for a group intending to move north, a roll of 1 indicates that the characters are now actually heading west; a roll of 3 means that their course has (unknown to them] shifted to the northeast.

This change of direction applies only to the characters’ travel during the last half of the current turn. On the next turn, if the chance of getting lost still exists, the characters make another check. If that check fails, they continue to be unaware of their change in heading. On a successful check, the characters realize they have moved off course and in what direction.

The characters might not realize they are lost unless they encounter an obstacle that indicates they are heading in the wrong direction. If the characters realize they have lost their way, you stop rolling for deviation in their course until they fail another check to avoid becoming lost.

### Заблудились

There are many ways to get lost in the wilderness. Following an obvious road, trail, or feature such as a stream or lakeshore prevents any possibility of becoming lost, but trav￾elers striking off cross-country may become disoriented—es￾pecially in conditions of poor visibility or in difficult terrain.

**Poor Visibility:** Any time characters cannot see at least 60 feet in the prevail￾ing conditions of visibility, they may be￾come lost. Characters traveling through fog, snow, or a downpour might easily lose the ability to see any landmarks not in their immediate vicinity. Similarly, characters travel￾ing at night may be at risk, too, de￾pending on the quality of their light sources, the amount of moonlight, and whether or not they have dark￾vision or low-light vision.

**Difficult Terrain:** Any character in forest, moor, hill, or mountain terrain may become lost if he or she moves away from a trail, road, stream, or other obvious path or track.

**Chance to Get Lost:** If conditions exist that make getting lost a possibility, the character leading the way must succeed at a Wilderness Lore check or become lost. The difficulty of this check varies based on the terrain, the visibility condi￾tions, and whether or not the character has a map of the area being traveled through.

Check once per hour (or portion of an hour) spent in local or overland movement to see if travelers have become lost.

In the case of a party moving together, only the character leading the way makes the check. (DM Tip: Make this check in secret, since the characters may not realize that they’re lost right away.)

Effects of Being Lost: If a party becomes lost, it is no longer certain of moving in the direction it intended to travel.

Randomly determine the direction the party actually travels in during each hour of local or overland movement. The char￾acters’ movement continues to be random until they blunder into a landmark they can’t miss, or until they recognize that they are lost and make an effort to regain their bearings.

Recognizing that You’re Lost: Once per hour of random travel, each character in the party may attempt a Wilderness Lore check (DC 20 –1 per hour of random travel) to recognize that they are no longer certain of their direction of travel. Some circumstances may make it obvious that the characters are lost; if they expected to reach a certain spot within an hour but three or four hours pass by with no sign of their destination, that’s a bad sign.

Setting a New Course: A lost party is also uncertain of determin￾ing in which direction it should travel in order to reach a desired objective—even an objective such as “the point where we left the road and went off into these dratted woods.” Determining the correct direction of travel once a party has become lost re￾quires a Wilderness Lore check (DC 15 +2 per hour of random travel). If a character fails in this

check, he chooses a random direction as the “correct” direction for resuming travel. (DM Tip: Again, this is a check you should make in secret. The lost characters may think they know the way to travel after regaining their bearings, but could be entirely wrong again.) Once the characters are traveling along their new course, correct or incorrect, it’s entirely possible for them to get lost again. If the conditions still make it possible for travelers to become lost, check once per hour of travel as described under Chance to Get Lost to see if the party maintains its new course, or begins to move at random again.

Conflicting Directions: It’s possible that several characters may attempt to determine the right direction to proceed after becoming lost. That’s just fine. The DM makes a Wil￾derness Lore check for each character in secret, then tells the players whose characters succeeded the correct direction to travel, and tells the players whose characters failed a random direction they think is right. (DM Tip: A few extraneous die rolls behind your screen might make it less apparent which characters are right and which characters are wrong.)

Regaining Your Bearings: There are several ways to be￾come un-lost. First, if the characters successfully set a new course and follow it to the destination they’re trying to reach, they’re not lost anymore. Second, the characters through random movement might run into an unmistakable landmark. Third, if conditions suddenly improve—the fog lifts, the sun comes up, or the travelers use know direction to ascertain the correct direction of north—lost characters may attempt to set a new course, as described above, with a +4 bonus on the Wilderness Lore check. Finally, more powerful magic such as find the path may make their course clear.

**Extreme Cold**

Whenever the temperature is at or below 0 degrees Fahrenheit, a creature exposed to the cold must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour or gain one level of exhaustion. Creatures with resistance or immunity to cold damage automatically succeed on the saving throw and creatures naturally adapted to cold climates.

*Cold weather outfit gives advantage on this check.*

**Extreme Heat**

When the temperature is at or above 100 degrees Fahrenheit, a creature exposed to the heat and without access to drinkable water must succeed on a Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour or gain one level of exhaustion. The DC is 5 for the first hour and increases by 1 for each additional hour.

Creatures wearing medium or heavy armor, or who are clad in heavy clothing, have disadvantage on the saving throw. Creatures with resistance or immunity to fire damage automatically succeed on the saving throw, as do creatures naturally adapted to hot climates.

**Strong Wind**
A strong wind imposes disadvantage on ranged weapon attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing. A strong wind also extinguishes open flames, disperses fog, and makes flying by nonmagical means nearly impossible. A flying creature in a strong wind must land at the end of its turn or fall.

A strong wind in a desert can create a sandstorm that imposes disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

**Heavy Precipitation**

Everything within an area of heavy rain or heavy snowfall is lightly obscured, and creatures in the area have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. Heavy rain also extinguishes open flames and imposes disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing.

**High Altitude**

Traveling at altitudes of 10,000 feet or higher above sea level is taxing for a creature that needs to breathe, because of the reduced amount of oxygen in the air. Each hour such a creature spends traveling at high altitude counts as 2 hours for the purpose of determining how long that creature can travel.

Breathing creatures can become acclimated to a high altitude by spending 30 days or more at this elevation. Breathing creatures can't become acclimated to elevations above 20,000 feet unless they are native to such environments.

## Wilderness Hazards

This section describes a few examples of hazards that adventurers might encounter in the wilderness.

Some hazards, such as slippery ice and razorvine, require no ability check to spot. Others, such as defiled ground, are undetectable by normal senses.

The other hazards presented here can be identified with a successful Intelligence (Nature) check. Use the guidelines in chapter 8 to set an appropriate DC for any check made to spot or recognize a hazard.

### Desecrated Ground

Some cemeteries and catacombs are imbued with the unseen traces of ancient evil. An area of desecrated ground can be any size, and a detect evil and good spell cast within range reveals its presence.

Undead standing on desecrated ground have advantage on all saving throws.

A vial of holy water purifies a 10-foot-square area of desecrated ground when sprinkled on it, and a hallow spell purifies desecrated ground within its area.

### Frigid Water

A creature can be immersed in frigid water for a number of minutes equal to its Constitution score before suffering any ill effects. Each additional minute spent in frigid water requires the creature to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion. Creatures with resistance or immunity to cold damage automatically succeed on the saving throw, as do creatures that are naturally adapted to living in ice-cold water.

### Quicksand

A quicksand pit covers the ground in roughly a 10-foot square area and is usually 10 feet deep. When a creature enters the area, it sinks 1d4+1 feet into the quicksand and becomes restrained. At the start of each of the creature's turns, it sinks another 1d4 feet. As long as the creature isn't completely submerged in quicksand, it can escape by using its action and succeeding on a Strength check. The DC is 10 plus the number of feet the creature has sunk into the quicksand. A creature that is completely submerged in quicksand can't breathe (see the suffocation rules in the Player's Handbook).

A creature can pull another creature within its reach out of a quicksand pit by using its action and succeeding on a Strength check. The DC is 5 plus the number of feet the target creature has sunk into the quicksand.

### Razorvine

Razorvine is a plant that grows in wild tangles and hedges. It also clings to the sides of buildings and other surfaces as ivy does. A 10-foot-high, 10-foot-wide, 5-foot-thick wall or hedge of razorvine has AC 11, 25 hit points, and immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and psychic damage.

When a creature comes into direct contact with razorvine for the first time on a turn, the creature must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or take 5 (1d10) slashing damage from the razorvine's bladelike thorns.

### Slippery Ice

Slippery ice is difficult terrain. When a creature moves onto slippery ice for the first time on a turn, it must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or fall prone.

### Thin Ice

Thin ice has a weight tolerance of 3d10 × 10 pounds per 10-foot-square area. Whenever the total weight on an area of thin ice exceeds its tolerance, the ice in that area breaks. All creatures on broken ice fall through.

## ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS

In this section you can find new environmental hazards, which follows similar rules as traps or lair actions. To determine the DC and damage, use the following tables

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Danger level | d20
--------|---------
Setback | 1-11
Dangerous	| 12-15	
Deadly | 16-20	

**DAMAGE SEVERITY BY LEVEL**

Character Level | Setback	| Dangerous	| Deadly
1st-4th	| IdlO	2dl 0	4dl 0
5th-1Oth|2d10|4d10|lOdlO
I "Ith-I 6th	4d10	lOdlO|18dl 0
I 7th-20th | 10d10 | 18dl0 | 24d19


### AVALANCHES, ROCKFALLS AND MUDSLIDES
*Any Level of Hazard*

Any character in the area where the hazard occurs must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes bludgeoning damage and is buried by the hazard, or half as much damage on a successful one. The area is filled with snow, rubble or mud and becomes difficult terrain.
Any buried creature is considered suffocated, and it can dig through to free itself. To do so, the creature must succeed a number of Strength (Athletics) checks, as shown in the following table.

Hazard Level | Number of Checks
Setback	| 2
Dangerous	| 3
Deadly | 4

### HAILSTORM
*Dangerous Hazard*

Similar to a blizzard, the terrain affected by the hailstorm is considered difficult terrain. When a creature without proper shelter is in the area affected by the hailstorm for one hour, it must make a Constitution saving throw, taking cold damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.


A cloud of swarming insects fills a 20-foot-radius sphere. The swarm moves at 20 feet on each round When a creature enters the cloud it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes piercing damage, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the cloud must roll another saving throw. A creature cannot be damaged by the insect swarm if it’s wielding a torch or if it is at least 5 feet from a fire.

### BLIZZARD
*Setback Hazard*

The area affected by a blizzard is considered difficult terrain. When a creature without proper shelter is in the area affected by the blizzard for one hour, it must make a Constitution saving throw, taking cold damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. If a creature is wearing warm clothing, it has advantage on the saving throw.

### EARTHQUAKES
*Any Level of Hazard*

A tremor shakes the area; each creature on the ground in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.
The hazard level is determined by the proximity to the epicenter or the intensity of the earth tremor:
•	Setback. Far from the epicenter or light earthquake.
•	Dangerous. Near the epicenter or moderate earthquake.
•	Deadly. Very close to the epicenter or severe earthquake.

### ELEMENTAL CLOUD
*Any Level of Hazard*

This cloud is made with elemental essence. When a creature enters the cloud, it must make an appropriate saving throw, taking damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the cloud must roll another saving throw./

Cloud Color	Damage Type	Saving Throw
Black	Necrotic	Constitution
Cyan	Cold	Constitution
Gray and Yellow	Lightning	Dexterity
Light Green	Acid	Constitution
Purple	Psychic	Wisdom
Red	Fire	Constitution
White	Force	Intelligence

### LAVA
*Deadly Hazard*

The lava is considered difficult terrain. Any creature that enters the lava takes fire damage. A creature that ends its turn in the lava takes fire damage. 

### LIGHTNING STORMS
*Dangerous or Deadly Hazard*

The DM rolls a dlOO to determine if any creature is hit by a lightning.
This check can be made at the beginning of each turn during a combat or in any time while the party is not in combat.
dlOO | Number of Creatures
-----------|--------------
1-50 | 0
51-70 | ld4
71-20 | 1d6
81-90	| 1d8
91-100 | 1d10

The creatures hit by a lightning are determined by the DM, and any creature in the area under total cover from above cannot take damage.

### MAGMA ERUPTIONS
*Dangerous Hazard*

Magma erupts from a point on the ground, creating a 20-foot- high, 5-foot-radius geyser. Each creature in the geyser's area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

### ROGUE WAVE
*Dangerous Hazard*

### POISON CLOUDS AND SPORES

Setback Hazard
When a creature enters the cloud, it must make a Constitution saving throw, taking poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the cloud must make another saving throw.

## DANGEROUS TERRAINS

In the following section you can find survival considerations and hazards for various terrains. You can combine different terrains to create a more dynamic (and probably more deadly) environment.

### ARCTIC

Cold and Extreme Cold The temperatures in this environment are lower than other places, and you need proper gear for resisting this temperatures. Whenever the temperature is at or below 0 degrees Fahrenheit, you must follow the rules of extreme cold

Food Scarcity. It's hard to find food like plants and creatures due the low temperatures. All the checks for foraging and hunting have a DC equal to 20.

Shelter. In general, the arctic areas are vast frozen plains with big glaciers and rocks, making it difficult to find a natural shelter.

ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS

Hazard  | Source | Notes
-----------|-------------|-------------
Avalanches	| CAW, P.5 5 | Only near mountains
Blizzard	| CAW, P.5 5 | 
Elemental Cloud	| CAW. 5 5 | Cyan clouds only
Frigid Water	| DMG, P.110|
Hailstorm	| CAW, P.5 5| 
Chasms and Ice Cracks	| DMG, P.l 22 | Use the pits trap
Slippery Ice	| DMG, P.110 |
Thin Ice	| DMG, P.lll |



### CAVES


Darkness and Light. Most of the natural caves don't have light sources, so anyone who enters must bring their sources of light and fire for warmth, cooking and in some cases, defense. A caves might have some light sources, such as groups of fluorescent fungus or other dangerous light sources, like lava.

Orientation and tracking. Inside a cave it's almost impossible to determine where's North: lots of caves are just tunnels connected, making it more difficult to create an accurate map of it.

Flooding. Some parts of the caves might be close to a water source or any other liquid that can quickly fill a room.

ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS

Earthquakes	CAW, P.5 5	Might cause rockfalls
Elemental Cloud	CAW, P.5 5	
Lava	CAW, P.5 5	
Pits	DMG, P.122	
Rockfalls	CAW, P.5 5	
Unsteady Ground	CAW, P.56	


### DESERT		


Heat and Extreme Heat. The opposite of the arctic terrain, temperatures in this environment are higher than other places, and you need enough water supplies for resisting the heat. Whenever the temperature is at or above 100 degrees Fahrenheit, you must follow the rules of extreme heat.

Shelter. In general, the desert areas are just sand and rocks (in some areas they might be some scattered shrubs) making it difficult to find a safe campsite.

Strong Wind A strong wind imposes disadvantage on ranged weapon attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing. A strong wind also extinguishes open flames, disperses fog, and makes flying by nonmagical means nearly impossible. A flying creature in a strong wind must land at the end of its turn or fall A strong wind in a desert can create a sandstorm that imposes disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

Water Scarcity. Finding water in a desert is extremely difficult, unless you're near an Oasis. All checks made for getting water have a DC equal to 20.

Hazard	Source	Notes
Earthquakes	CAW, P.5 5	
Elemental Cloud	CAW, P.5 5	Mostly red clouds
Lightning Storms	CAW, P.56

### FORESTS AND JUNGLES

Density. Sometimes is hard to walk through a forest due the great number of plants, trees and vegetation. In most of the cases, you can't walk in a straight line through the forest. Orientation and tracking. Inside a forest, the trees covers the sky, making it hard to determine where's North, and depending the density of the forest it might be harder to keep a track.

Sight and hearing. It might be more difficult to see or hear your surroundings because the density of the forest, the tree shadows, obstacles (such a fallen tree) and the sound of the trees and vegetation moving with the wind

### LAKES, RIVERS AND OCEAN


Orientation and tracking. In the middle of the ocean or under a storm, it's difficult to determine the cardinal points without the proper tools.
Shipwrecks. In the ocean, lakes and even in rivers there're rocks, icebergs, and more that can damage or destroy a ship or boat.
Water streams. The river streams can change drastically depending on the terrain around the rivers, like the terrain elevation, inclination and waterfalls.

Rapids	CAW, P.56	Rivers only
Rogue Wave	CAW, P.56	Ocean only

### MOUNTAINS		


Altitude. When you're traveling at altitudes of 10,000 feet or higher above sea level, you must follow the high altitude rules. 

Strong wind A strong wind imposes disadvantage on ranged weapon attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing. A strong wind also extinguishes open flames, disperses fog, and makes flying by nonmagical means nearly impossible. A flying creature in a strong wind must land at the end of its turn or fall A strong wind in a desert can create a sandstorm that imposes disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

HIGH ALTITUDE (DMC, P.110)
Traveling at altitudes of 1 0,000 feet or higher above sea level is taxing for a creature that needs to breathe, because of the reduced amount of oxygen in the air. Each hour such a creature spends traveling at high altitude counts as 2 hours for the purpose of determining how long that creature can travel.

Breathing creatures can become acclimated to a high altitude by spending 30 days or more at this elevation. Breathing creatures can't become acclimated to elevations above 20,000 feet unless they are native to such environments.

Lightning Storms	CAW, P.5 6
Magma Eruptions	CAW, P.56 Near Volcanoes
Unsteady Ground	CAW, P.5 6



### SWAMPS

Clean water. Swamps are characterized by having slow- moving and stagnant waters, being harder to find drinkable water. Drinking stagnant water might cause diseases. Warmth. The swamps are wet and soggy, so finding dry resources for making a fire it's almost impossible.

Low visibility. Mist, fog and lowlands are common in this terrain, and they reduces the visibility of any creature.

### SPECIAL TERRAINS
In the wilderness, there're places that have been touched by ancient magic or energies for centuries, creating a persistent effect on those lands. Here're some ideas for creating special terrains you can add to flesh a particular zone in the wild

#### BLOOD ROCK
This area was part of old and forgotten ceremonial sacrifices, a massive battle between armies that fought for centuries or the place where a powerful otherwordly creature was slain. The area is covered by stones with a red tone, bones covered by dirt and mud and dry blood Any creature standing in this area can score a critical hit on a 19 or 20.
Long-Term Effect: A creature must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw at the end of each hour. On a failed save, the creature must use its action each round to attack the nearest creature it sees. At the end of each of its turns, the creature can make a new Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the effect ends until another hour passes.

#### DEATH CIRCLE RUINS
This area surrounded by dark stone pillars is infused with necrotic energy. Any healing effect, such as a cure wounds spell only heals half the total amount in this area.
Long-Term Effect: A living creature must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour. On a failed save, its hit point maximum is reduced by ld6. To recover the reduced hit points, the creature must spend 1 hour outside the area covered by the death circle ruins.

#### DEFILED GROUND
The dark energy fills this area, attracting undead creatures to this area. Any undead creature gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls while standing in the defiled ground Additionally, when an undead is reduced to 0 hit points, roll a d20. On a 10 or higher, the undead creature rises with 1 hit point on its next turn. If an undead is reduced to 0 hit points by radiant damage, it cannot roll for rising again.
Long-Term Effect: A creature must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour. On a failed save, it takes 5 necrotic damage.

#### GRAB GRASS
This thick, tough grass grows in areas constantly touched by Feywild magic that clings to characters and creatures that falls prone. An area covered by grab grass is considered difficult terrain, and any creature that falls prone in this area must make a Strength (Athletics) check to stand up (DC 10)

#### LIFE CIRCLE RUINS
This area surrounded by white stone pillars is infused with pure life energy. Every 1 minute, any living creature that begins its turn in the area regains 2 hit points.
Long-Term Effect: Any living creature that stays in this area for 1 hour can end either one disease or one condition afflicting it. The condition can be blinded, deafened, paralyzed or poisoned

#### PLANETOUCHED
Due to planar energy, a powerful artifact or some other factor, this terrain boosts certain types of energy related to one plane. Pick one damage type from the following list: Acid Cold Fire, Force, Lightning, Necrotic, Psychic or Radiant. Any attack that deals the chosen damage type deals an extra ld6 damage of that type.

#### SACRED SHRINE
A sacred shrine is dedicated to a particular deity, infusing with divine energy the area nearby. A creature that shares the deity's alignment gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls while standing in the area covered by the shrine.
Long-Term Effect: A creature that has a different alignment to the deity's alignment must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw at the end of each hour. On a failed save, it has disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures that shares the deity's alignment. At the end of each of its turns, the creature can make a new Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the effect ends until another hour passes.







# Дикая местность

Всякий раз, когда персонажи покидают относитель¬ную безопасность Смертельных Снегов и путешествуют на большие расстояния, они подвергаются жестоким погодным условиям и опасным чудовищам диких мест. Смертельные Снега и земли на севере рассматриваются как открытая местность с целью определения случайной погоды (смотрите Главу 2), в то время как большинство других мест в городке и вокруг него считаются альпийскими областями.

С целью столкновений в дикой местности при¬нимайте Смертельные Снега и земли севернее как часть Лунных Земель, Долины Адбар и региона Холодной Долины (**Таблица 2)**. Очевидно, что любой идущий в горы, окружающие город, путешествует через Незерийские Горы (**Таблица 6**). Некоторые из случайных столкновений в дикой местности могут быть смертельными для партий среднего уровня. Шанс столкновения в течение каждого часа путешествия зависит от старания персонажей идти быстро или осторожно, смотрите Столкновения в дикой местности в Главе 2.

Никаких столкновений в дикой местности не происходит в пределах 2 миль от городских стен в тече¬ние дня или в пределах 1 мили - ночью или в плохую погоду. Даже чудища обходят городок стороной, если не ищут себе неприятностей.

# Natural Hazards

Hungry monsters and rapacious brigands occupy the thoughts of many travelers in the North, but in truth these are not the deadliest dangers of this harsh land. Everyday oc￾currences such as a bitter cold snap in winter, an ill-timed snowfall, a forest fire, or a river in flood kill just as many travelers and homesteaders in the Silver Marches as mon￾sters do, and certainly have the potential to inflict much greater damage to property.

## AVALANCHES AND LANDSLIDES

The combination of high mountains and heavy snowfalls means that avalanches are a deadly peril in many areas around the North. The Lands Against the Wall, the Spine of the World, the Rauvin Mountains, and the passes through the Nether Mountains are particularly vulnerable. (Ironically, the Ice Mountains are not so dangerous, since they see less snowfall than their neighbors to the west.) If the snowpack is not high, death can still come hurtling down in the form of a landslide. The extremes of temperature common to the North fiercely weather the sides of mountains and cause many falling rocks throughout the year.

The effects of avalanches and landslides are described in The Environment in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide. The typical avalanche or landslide has a width of 1d6×100 feet, from one edge of the slide zone to the oppo￾site edge. The bury zone in the center of the avalanche is half as wide as the avalanche’s full width. To determine the pre￾cise location of characters in the path of an avalanche, roll 1d6×20; the result is the number of feet from the center of the path taken by the bury zone to the center of the party’s location. Avalanches advance at a speed of 500 feet per round, landslides at a speed of 250 feet per round.

## THE CLAWS OF THE COLD

Even in the summertime, the mountain passes and high slopes plummet below freezing at night. Most old hands in the Silver Marches own a good set of winter clothing, and are wise enough to stay out of the sort of weather winter clothing won’t help against.

For the effect of cold and extremely cold weather condi￾tions on characters and creatures, see Weather and Cold Dan￾gers, both in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide.

Cold Water: Characters who become soaked or drenched in cold water (usually by immersion in a mountain stream, but marching in a downpour can do the job) are much more vulnerable to cold damage. Moderate temperatures are treated as cold conditions and cold temperatures are treated as extremely cold conditions for purposes of determining whether a soaked character is vulnerable to cold damage.

This vulnerability remains for 2d4 hours or until a character changes into dry clothes. Soaked clothing provides no protec￾tion against cold damage.

Characters who remain immersed in cold water take 1d6 points of subdual damage per minute of exposure from hy￾pothermia.

Permafrost: North of the Sundabar Vale, permafrost con￾ditions prevail. Even in summer, the ground remains frozen hard a foot or so beneath the surface, except around sun￾warmed rocks. Buried corpses and food in contact with per￾mafrost will freeze (though stone cairns are necessary to keep scavengers away), and ready ice is always handy.

Frozen Lakes and Rivers: During winter, most bodies of water in the Silver Marches freeze over. Most years, the freeze comes in the month of Marpenoth, beginning 1d10+20 days into the month. The ice lasts until the month of Ches, disappearing 1d10+20 days into the month. The thickness of the ice depends on the month and whether or not the water is flowing:

| Month     | Standing Water | Flowing Water |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|
| Marpenoth | Thin           | —             |
|           |                |               |
| Uktar     | Moderate       | Thin          |
|           |                |               |
| Nightal   | Thick          | Moderate      |
|           |                |               |
| Hammer    | Thick          | Thick         |
|           |                |               |
| Alturiak  | Thick          | Thick         |
|           |                |               |
| Ches      | Thin           | Thin          |

Thin ice is 1 to 2 inches thick. It supports Small creatures. Medium-size creatures that run, jump, fall, or fight on the ice may cause a break (50% chance per round of such activity).

Moderate ice is 3 to 11 inches thick. It supports Large crea￾tures. Huge creatures that run, jump, fall, or fight on the ice may cause a break (50% chance per round of such activity).

Thick ice may be anywhere from 1 to 4 feet thick. It sup￾ports creatures of any size. Ice has 3 hit points per inch of thickness. If a creature too heavy for the ice causes a break, the ice collapses in a circle whose radius is 5 feet larger than the face (or dimensions) of the creature causing the break. Any creature caught in the fracture area except for the creature causing the break may attempt a Reflex save (DC 15) to reach safe ice before it gives way.

Thin ice is particularly dangerous, because the edges of a fractured area tend to crumble under a swimmer’s efforts to climb out. To climb out, a Small or Medium-size swimmer must succeed at an Escape Artist check (DC 15). Large crea￾tures can’t get back on top of thin ice after it fractures.

Frozen rivers are dangerous, too. Creatures who fall through the ice of a frozen river may be swept away from the hole by the current and trapped under the ice. Apply the drowning rule (see Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide) as necessary.  FOREST FIRES

Most campfire sparks ignite nothing, but if conditions are dry, winds are strong, or the forest floor is dried out and flammable, a forest fire can result. Lightning strikes often set trees afire and start forest fires in this way. Luckily, the lands of the Silver Marches are almost always damp. Small “scorch-smolders” of blackened vegetation are the usual result, not conflagrations that spread for miles. Yet travelers can get caught in fires. The leading edge of a fire (the downwind side) can advance faster than a human can run (assume 120 feet per round for winds of moderate strength). Once a particular portion of the forest is ablaze, it re￾mains so for 2d4×10 minutes before dying to a smolder. Within the bounds of a forest fire, a character faces three dangers: heat damage, catching on fire, and smoke inhalation.

**Heat:** Getting caught within a forest fire is even worse than being exposed to abysmal heat (see Heat Dangers in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide). Breathing the air causes a character to take 1d6 points of damage per round (no save). In addition, a character must make a Fortitude save every 5 rounds (DC 15, +1 per previous check) or sustain 1d4 points of subdual damage. A character who holds his breath can avoid the normal damage, but not the subdual damage.

**Catching on Fire:** Characters engulfed in a forest fire are at risk of catching on fire when the leading edge of the fire overtakes them, and are then at risk once per minute thereafter. See Catch￾ing on Fire in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide.

**Smoke:** Forest fires naturally produce a great deal of smoke. A character who breathes heavy smoke must make a Fortitude saving throw each round (DC 15, +1 per previous check) or spend that round choking and coughing. A charac￾ter who chokes for two consecutive rounds takes 1d6 points of subdual damage. Also, smoke obscures vision, giving one￾half concealment (20% miss chance) to characters within it.

## FLOODS

In locales throughout the Silver Marches where heavy pre￾cipitation and steep slopes prevail, floods are common.

**Rivers in Flood:** In spring, the enormous snowmelt from the slopes of the Nether and Rauvin mountains engorges most of the streams and rivers in and around the Silver Marches. During spring flood, rivers become wider, deeper, and swifter. Assume that a river rises by 1d10+10 feet during the spring flood, and its width increases by a factor of 1d4×50%. Fords may disappear for days, bridges may be swept away, and even ferries might not be able to manage the crossing of a flooded river.A river in flood adds +5 to the DC of any Swim checks that characters attempt. For example, Striding Giant Rapids on the Rauvin might normally be considered rough water (see the Swim skill description in Chapter 4 of the Player’s Hand￾book), which means that Swim checks to get across the river are against DC 15. When this area is in spring flood, the DC rises to 20. (The increase in water depth may make fords too deep for most travelers to wade successfully, so swimming may be their best option if crossing the river is necessary.)

**Mountain Torrent:** Innumerable swift, strong streams cascade down out of the mountains of the Silver Marches in all seasons. In general, the typical mountain torrent is 5d6 feet in width and studded with boulders. Waterfalls 1d6×10 feet in height occur every 1d4 miles. Unlucky or clumsy characters may find themselves in a fast-moving gauntlet of icy water, deadly rocks, and sudden waterfalls. Refer to Water Dangers in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide. Characters swept away by the torrent must attempt Swim checks (DC 15) every round to avoid going under. If a character gets a skill check result of 5 or more over the minimum necessary, he arrests his motion by catching a rock, tree limb, or bottom snag—he is no longer being carried along by the flow of the water. Escaping a torrent by reaching the bank requires three suc￾cessful Swim checks (DC 15) in a row. Characters arrested by a rock, limb, or snag can’t escape unless they strike out into the water and attempt to swim their way clear.

**Flash Floods:** These sudden, short-lived torrents occur after heavy rains or ice breakups in spring. A flash flood typically lasts only 4d4 minutes before the waters recede.  Flash floods advance at a speed of 60 feet. See Flash Floods under Weather Hazards in Chapter 3 of the DUN￾GEON MASTER’s Guide.  FOG

The forgotten peril of the North is its everpresent river mist and mountain fog. Characters traveling along a river by boat  can’t get too lost, of course. However, fogbound overland travel offers a real possibility of running into trees, gullies, and other hazards. A typical fog limits vision to a distance of 1d10×5 feet, completely foiling normal vision and darkvi￾sion beyond this range. Creatures closer than the absolute limit of visibility gain the benefits of one-half concealment (20% miss chance).  

##  Encountering Hazards

An encounter with a natural hazard in motion, such as an avalanche or a forest fire, begins in a particular way de￾pending on the type of hazard.

**Avalanche/Landslide:** An avalanche or landslide can be spotted from as far away as 1d10×500 feet by a character who makes a successful Spot check (DC 20). The DC of the Spot check is modified by any of the conditions that apply from Table 3–2 in the DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide. (Con￾sider the avalanche to be a Colossal encounter, meaning that the DC is immediately reduced by 16.) If all charac￾ters fail their Spot checks to determine the encounter dis￾tance, the avalanche moves closer to them, and they automatically become aware of it when it closes to half the original distance.

It’s possible to hear an avalanche coming even if you can’t see it. Under optimum conditions (no other loud noises occurring), a character who makes a successful Listen check (DC 15) can hear the avalanche or landslide when it is 1d6×500 feet away. This check might have a DC of 20, 25, or higher in conditions where hearing is difficult (such as in the middle of a thunderstorm).

**Forest Fire:** A forest fire can be spotted from as far away as 2d6×100 feet by a character who makes a success￾ful Spot check (DC 20). The DC of the Spot check is modi￾fied by any of the conditions that apply from Table 3–2 in the DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide. (Consider the fire to be a Colossal encounter, meaning that the DC is immediately reduced by 16.) If all characters fail their Spot checks to determine the encounter distance, the fire moves closer to them, and they automatically see it when it closes to half the original distance.Characters who are blinded or otherwise unable to make Spot checks can feel the heat of the fire (and thus auto￾matically “spot” it) when it is 100 feet away.

# Natural Hazards

Hungry monsters and rapacious brigands occupy the thoughts of many travelers in the North, but in truth these are not the deadliest dangers of this harsh land. Everyday oc￾currences such as a bitter cold snap in winter, an ill-timed snowfall, a forest fire, or a river in flood kill just as many travelers and homesteaders in the Silver Marches as mon￾sters do, and certainly have the potential to inflict much
greater damage to property.

## AVALANCHES AND LANDSLIDES

The combination of high mountains and heavy snowfalls means that avalanches are a deadly peril in many areas around the North. The Lands Against the Wall, the Spine of the World, the Rauvin Mountains, and the passes through the Nether Mountains are particularly vulnerable. (Ironically, the Ice Mountains are not so dangerous, since they see less snowfall than their neighbors to the west.) If the snowpack is not high, death can still come hurtling down in the form of a landslide. The extremes of temperature common to the North fiercely weather the sides of mountains and cause many falling rocks throughout the year.
The effects of avalanches and landslides are described in The Environment in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide. The typical avalanche or landslide has a width of 1d6×100 feet, from one edge of the slide zone to the oppo￾site edge. The bury zone in the center of the avalanche is half
as wide as the avalanche’s full width. To determine the pre￾cise location of characters in the path of an avalanche, roll 1d6×20; the result is the number of feet from the center of the path taken by the bury zone to the center of the party’s location. Avalanches advance at a speed of 500 feet per round, landslides at a speed of 250 feet per round. 

## THE CLAWS OF THE COLD

Even in the summertime, the mountain passes and high slopes plummet below freezing at night. Most old hands in the Silver Marches own a good set of winter clothing, and are wise enough to stay out of the sort of weather winter clothing won’t help against.

For the effect of cold and extremely cold weather condi￾tions on characters and creatures, see Weather and Cold Dan￾gers, both in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide.
**Cold Water:** Characters who become soaked or drenched in cold water (usually by immersion in a mountain stream, but marching in a downpour can do the job) are much more vulnerable to cold damage. Moderate temperatures are treated as cold conditions and cold temperatures are treated as extremely cold conditions for purposes of determining whether a soaked character is vulnerable to cold damage.

This vulnerability remains for 2d4 hours or until a character changes into dry clothes. Soaked clothing provides no protec￾tion against cold damage.ake 1d6 points of subdual damage per minute of exposure from hy￾pothermia.Permafrost: North of the Sundabar Vale, permafrost con￾ditions prevail. Even in summer, the ground remains frozen hard a foot or so beneath the surface, except around sun￾warmed rocks. Buried corpses and food in contact with per￾mafrost will freeze (though stone cairns are necessary to keep scavengers away), and ready ice is always handy.
Frozen Lakes and Rivers: During winter, most bodies of water in the Silver Marches freeze over. Most years, the freeze comes in the month of Marpenoth, beginning 1d10+20 days into the month. The ice lasts until the month of Ches, disappearing 1d10+20 days into the month. The thickness of the ice depends on the month and whether or not the water is flowing: 


Month     | Standing Water | Flowing Water
----------|----------------|--------------
Marpenoth | Thin           | —
Uktar     | Moderate       | Thin
Nightal   | Thick          | Moderate
Hammer    | Thick          | Thick
Alturiak  | Thick          | Thick
Ches      | Thin           | Thin

Thin ice is 1 to 2 inches thick. It supports Small creatures. Medium-size creatures that run, jump, fall, or fight on the ice may cause a break (50% chance per round of such activity).
Moderate ice is 3 to 11 inches thick. It supports Large crea￾tures. Huge creatures that run, jump, fall, or fight on the ice may cause a break (50% chance per round of such activity).

Thick ice may be anywhere from 1 to 4 feet thick. It sup￾ports creatures of any size. Ice has 3 hit points per inch of thickness. If a creature too heavy for the ice causes a break, the ice collapses in a circle whose radius is 5 feet larger than the face (or dimensions) of the creature causing the break. Any creature caught in the fracture area except for the creature causing the break may attempt a Reflex save (DC 15) to reach safe ice before it gives way. 

Thin ice is particularly dangerous, because the edges of a fractured area tend to crumble under a swimmer’s efforts to climb out. To climb out, a Small or Medium-size swimmer must succeed at an Escape Artist check (DC 15). Large crea￾tures can’t get back on top of thin ice after it fractures.

Frozen rivers are dangerous, too. Creatures who fall through the ice of a frozen river may be swept away from the hole by the current and trapped under the ice. Apply the drowning rule (see Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide) as necessary.  

## FOREST FIRES

Most campfire sparks ignite nothing, but if conditions are dry, winds are strong, or the forest floor is dried out and flammable, a forest fire can result. Lightning strikes often set trees afire and start forest fires in this way. Luckily, the lands of the Silver Marches are almost always damp. Small “scorch-smolders” of blackened vegetation are the usual result, not conflagrations that spread for miles. Yet travelers can get caught in fires. The leading edge of a fire (the downwind side) can advance faster than a human can run (assume 120 feet per round for winds of moderate strength). Once a particular portion of the forest is ablaze, it re￾mains so for 2d4×10 minutes before dying to a smolder. Within the bounds of a forest fire, a character faces three dangers: heat damage, catching on fire, and smoke inhalation.

**Heat:** Getting caught within a forest fire is even worse than being exposed to abysmal heat (see Heat Dangers in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide). Breathing the air causes a character to take 1d6 points of damage per round (no save). In addition, a character must make a Fortitude save every 5 rounds (DC 15, +1 per previous check) or sustain 1d4 points of subdual damage. A character who holds his breath can avoid the normal damage, but not the subdual damage. 
Catching on Fire: Characters engulfed in a forest fire are at risk of catching on fire when the leading edge of the fire overtakes them, and are then at risk once per minute thereafter. See Catch￾ing on Fire in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide.

**Smoke: Forest** fires naturally produce a great deal of smoke. A character who breathes heavy smoke must make a Fortitude saving throw each round (DC 15, +1 per previous check) or spend that round choking and coughing. A charac￾ter who chokes for two consecutive rounds takes 1d6 points of subdual damage. Also, smoke obscures vision, giving one￾half concealment (20% miss chance) to characters within it.

Escaping a torrent by reaching the bank requires three suc￾cessful Swim checks (DC 15) in a row. Characters arrested by a rock, limb, or snag can’t escape unless they strike out into the water and attempt to swim their way clear.

**Flash Floods:** These sudden, short-lived torrents occur after heavy rains or ice breakups in spring. A flash flood typically lasts only 4d4 minutes before the waters recede.  Flash floods advance at a speed of 60 feet. See Flash Floods under Weather Hazards in Chapter 3 of the DUN￾GEON MASTER’s Guide. 

## FOG

The forgotten peril of the North is its everpresent river mist and mountain fog. Characters traveling along a river by boat  can’t get too lost, of course. However, fogbound overland travel offers a real possibility of running into trees, gullies, and other hazards. A typical fog limits vision to a distance of 1d10×5 feet, completely foiling normal vision and darkvi￾sion beyond this range. Creatures closer than the absolute limit of visibility gain the benefits of one-half concealment (20% miss chance).

## Путешествие по горам

High altitude can be extremely fatiguing—or sometimes deadly—to creatures that aren’t used to it. Cold becomes ex￾treme, and the lack of oxygen in the air can wear down even the most hardy of warriors.

Acclimated Characters: Creatures accustomed to high alti￾tude generally fare better than lowlanders. Any creature nor￾mally found in mountain terrain is considered native to the area, and acclimated to the high altitude. Characters with the Endurance feat, 4 ranks of Wilderness Lore, or 7 ranks of Climb are also acclimated to high altitude.

Undead, constructs, and other creatures that do not breathe are immune to altitude effects.

**Altitude Bands:** In general, mountains present three possi￾ble altitude bands: low pass, low peak/high pass, and high peak.

Low Pass (lower than 7,000 feet): Most travel in low mountains takes place in low passes. Travelers may find the going difficult (which is reflected in the movement modi￾fiers for traveling through mountains), but there are no un￾usual weather or altitude effects.

Low Peak or High Pass (7,000 to 20,000 feet): Ascending to the highest slopes of low mountains, or most normal travel through high mountains, falls into this category. At these ele￾vations, creatures may be subject to high altitude effects (see below). Temperatures at this level are one grade colder than the prevailing weather would indicate—for example, if the day’s temperature is moderate, it’s actually cold at this altitude.

High Peak (more than 20,000 feet): The highest slopes and peaks of high mountains exceed 20,000 feet in height. At these el￾evations, creatures may be subject to altitude sickness (see below).

Temperatures at this level are always two grades colder than the prevailing weather indicates—for example, if the day’s tempera￾ture is moderate, it’s actually extremely cold at this altitude.

High Altitude Effects: All nonacclimated creatures labor to breathe in the thin air at high altitude. See Lack of Air/High Altitude, under Other Dangers in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide. Acclimated characters are not subject to high altitude effects.

Altitude Sickness: Any creature at an altitude higher than 20,000 feet is subject to both high altitude effects and alti￾tude sickness, as described under Lack of Air/High Altitude in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide. Creatures acclimated to high altitude as described above receive a +4 bonus on their saving throws to resist high altitude effects and altitude sickness, but eventually even seasoned moun￾taineers must abandon these dangerous elevations.

## Зыбучие пески и топи

In moors, marshes, and other examples of sodden terrain, hidden, water-filled holes await the unwary. Obvious bogs are not very dangerous—everybody can recognize a mud￾hole or a scum-covered pond. However, some of these patches present a deceptively solid appearance and may trap careless characters. A character approaching a hidden bog or patch of quicksand at a normal pace is entitled to a Wilder￾ness Lore check (DC 8) to spot the danger before stepping in, but charging or running characters don’t have a chance to detect a hidden bog before blundering in. A typical patch of quicksand or quaking bog is (1d4+1)×5 feet in diameter; the momentum of a charging or running character carries him or her 1d2×5 feet into the bog.

**Effects of Quicksand:** Characters in quicksand must make a Swim check (DC 10) every round to simply tread water in place, or a Swim check (DC 15) to move 5 feet in whatever direction is desired. If a trapped character fails this check by 5 or more, he sinks below the surface and begins to drown whenever he can no longer hold his breath. Characters below the surface of a bog may swim back to the surface with a successful Swim check (DC 15 +1 per con￾secutive round of being under the surface).

Rescue: Pulling out a character trapped in quicksand can be difficult. A rescuer needs a branch, spear haft, rope, or similar tool that enables him to reach the victim with one end of it. Then he must make a Strength check (DC 15) to successfully pull the victim, and the victim must make a Strength check (DC 10) to hold onto the branch, pole, or rope. If the victim fails to hold on, he must make an imme￾diate Swim check (DC 15) to stay above the surface. If both checks succeed, the victim is pulled 5 feet closer to safety.

## RAIN, SNOW, SLEET, AND HAIL

Precipitation is a daily occurrence in the Silver Marches most of the year. Bad weather frequently slows or halts travel and makes it virtually impossible to navigate from one spot to another.

**Rain:** Rain is all too frequent in the North. Rain affects visibility, ranged attacks and Listen, Search, and Spot checks as described in Precipitation under Weather Hazards in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide. Characters caught out in steady rain become soaked in 2d6×10 minutes, which may make them more vulnerable to cold damage (see The Claws of the Cold earlier in this chapter).

**Downpours:** These sudden, heavy rains often cause flash floods in hilly or mountainous country. Downpours have all the properties of rain, except that visibility is reduced as de￾scribed below, and characters become soaked in 10 minutes, rendering them more susceptible to cold damage.

Visibility in a downpour is limited to a range of 1d10×5 feet. Creatures closer than the absolute limit of visibility gain one-half concealment (20% miss chance).

**Hail:** The effects of hail are described in Precipitation under Weather Hazards in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide. Hail in the North can be unusually heavy and dangerous—there is a 10% chance that the hail deals 1 point of damage to all creatures caught in the open, and if this happens, there’s a 20% chance that hailstones the size of a human fist (or bigger) fall. This extra-large hail deals 1d4 points of damage to any creature caught in the open. Fallen hail reduces movement by half, just like a fall of snow. In moderate or warm temperatures, it takes 1d4 hours for fallen hail to melt. In cold temperatures, hail remains on the ground for 4d4 hours.

**Sleet:** The ice storms of the North are legendary for their destructive power. Sleet has the same effects on visibility, ranged attacks, and Listen, Search, and Spot checks as rain, and reduces movement by half.

Sleet hisses as it falls, and coats everything with ice, creat￾ing slippery conditions for any skill checks affected by the conditions of the surface (Balance and Climb, for example). This slippery state lasts until snowfall covers the ice, or a thaw (one day of moderate or higher temperatures) melts it. In addition, sleet soaks characters in the open over the course of 2d6×10 minutes, making them more vulnerable to cold damage.

**Snow:** Falling snow has the same effects on visibility, ranged weapon attacks, and skill checks as rain, and reduces movement to half. A day of snowfall leaves 1d6 inches of snow on the ground. When the depth of the snow reaches half a creature’s height, movement is slowed to one-quarter normal, and when snow reaches a creature’s height, move￾ment is halved again.

Snow melts off at the rate of 4 inches per day of moder￾ate temperatures, 8 inches per day of warm temperatures, or 12 inches per day of hot temperatures.

**Heavy Snow:** Heavy snowfall has the same effects as normal snowfall, but also restricts visibility as fog does (see Fog, earlier in this section). A day of heavy snow leaves 1d3 feet of snow on the ground. Heavy snow accompanied by strong or severe winds may result in snowdrifts 1d4×5 feet in depth, especially in and around objects big enough to de￾flect the prevailing wind—a cabin or large tent, for instance. There is a 10% chance that a heavy snowfall is accompa￾nied by lightning (see below).

## LIGHTNING

Thunderstorms are common in the summer and early fall in the Silver Marches. A mountain thunderstorm is nothing to stand around and admire; it can be deadly. Lightning some￾times accompanies heavy snowfalls, too.

**Thunderstorms:** During a day in which thunderstorms appear, creatures in the open encounter 1d3 distinct storms. Each storm lasts for 2d6×10 minutes. There is a 20% chance per storm that a bolt endangers a creature or group of creatures in the open. Each lightning bolt inflicts 1d10 8-sided dice of damage in a 10-foot radius. Roll randomly to determine which char￾acter is at the center of the strike. Any threatened character (including the character at the center) is entitled to a Reflex save (DC 15) to take only half damage.

## SANDSTORMS

Thanks to the dampness of the North, duststorms are un￾known in these lands, but sandstorms—heavy particles driven by furious winds from Anauroch—occur from time to time.

They seldom reach west of Sundabar. Sandstorms reduce vis￾ibility to 1d10×5 feet and provide a –4 penalty on Listen, Search, and Spot checks. Sandstorms deal 1d3 points of subdual damage per hour to any creatures caught in the open, and leave a thin coating of sand (1d2 inches) in their wake.

For the race of the bandit group, roll d%: 01–10, dwarf; 11–70, human; 71–100, half-orc.

**Bugbear Band:** 1d10+10 bugbears, 1d3 bugbear warriors (level 1d3+1), and 1 bugbear fighter (level 1d4+3).

**Forest Fire:** In summer or fall, a forest fire endangers the characters. The fire covers a front 3d10×500 feet across, centered on the location of the party at the time the encounter was generated. See the Encountering Natural Hazards sidebar and Forest Fires, later in this chapter. In winter or spring, treat this as no encounter.

**Ghast Pack:** 1d3+1 **ghasts** and 1d6+1 **ghouls.**

**Ghost:**This encounter consists of 1d4 ghosts of level 1d4+2.

**Mountain Torrent:** The party encounters an unmarked stream in its path with no obvious means of crossing. There is a 50% chance that some kind of precarious crossing exists (a fallen log, or chain of boulders) that can be employed with a successful Balance check (DC 15). Failure on this check means that the character falls in the water and may be swept downstream; see Mountain Torrents under Floods in the following section. If the party is traveling along a road or trail, the stream is bridged in some fashion. Treat this as no encounter.

**NPCs:** The NPC party consists of 1d3+2 individuals (level 2d4). To determine the alignment, race, and class of each character, consult Tables 2–28 through 2–32 in the DUN￾GEON MASTER’s Guide, or use the corresponding tables in the FORGOTTEN REALMS DUNGEON MASTER’s Screen.

**Orc Marauders:** 1d10+5 **orcs,** 1d3+1 orc **berserkers** (level 1d3+1), and 1 orc **Eye of Gruumsh** accompanied by 1d2 dire boars.

**Orc Warband:** 1d10+10 orcs, 1d3 orc barbarians (level 1d3+1), 1d3 orc fighters (level 1d3+1), 1 orc adept (level 1d6), and 1 orc leader (level 1d3+3), accompanied by 1d2 dire boars. To determine the leader’s class, roll d%: 01–30, barbarian; 31–45, cleric; 46–80, fighter; 81–85, ranger; 86–90, rogue; 91–100, sorcerer.

**Uthgardt Scouts:** 1d4+2 tribal warriors and 1d2 leaders (level 1d6+1). For the leaders’ classes, roll d%: 01–50, barbarian; 51–65, cleric; 66–75, druid; 76–85, ranger; 86–90, rogue; 91–100, sorcerer. There is a 30% chance the group belongs to the Sky Pony tribe and is mounted. Uthgardt scouts are usually chaotic neutral.

**Vampire Troupe:** 1d2 **vampires** and 1d4+1 **vampire spawn.**

**Werewolf Raiders:** 1d4+1 **werewolves,** 1d4+4 **wolves,** and 1 werewolf leader (level 1d6+1). To determine the leader’s class, roll d%: 01–15, cleric; 16–25, druid; 26–60, fighter;61–75, ranger; 76–90, rogue; 91–100, sorcerer.

## NPCs parties for random encounters



# Random Weather

Many different weather influences impact the Silver Marches.

The prevailing weather patterns in this part of Faerûn tend to come from the Sea of Swords to the west, and the presence of high mountains on all sides often creates “cloud barriers” that force frequent precipitation. The presence of Anauroch nearby also influences the weather in unpredictable ways. Any particular day’s weather consists of three components: the temperature, the wind strength, and the precipitation.

Tables 8 through 11 provide random weather combina￾tions based on each season, weighted toward more or less likely results. A sudden thaw in the mountains is possible in winter, but it’s not as likely as long stretches of bitter cold or heavy snow.

## USING THE TABLES

Any given weather condition lasts for 1d6 days before a new pattern sets in, so it’s only necessary to roll for new weather when the previous pattern ends, not every day. The weather tables are organized into three basic locations: river valleys, open country, and northern or alpine areas. Apply the same die roll to all three regions (this makes it less likely that the mountains will be experiencing a rare thaw at the same time the river valleys are suffering from a brutal cold snap).

**River Valley:** The Rauvin and Sundabar vales fall into this category, as well as the eaves of the High Forest. Although plagued by heavy fogs throughout the year, these regions are more sheltered than other parts of the Silver Marches.

**Open Country:** The Evermoors, Moonlands, Old Delzoun (except for Sundabar Vale), and the forests of the northern Silver Marches fall into this category.

**Northern or Alpine Regions:** The Ice, Nether, and Rauvin mountains fall into this category, as well as other lands that are hard against the Spine of the World, such as the Druar￾wood and the Lands Against the Wall.

## DEFINITIONS

Results from Tables 8 through 11 are described below.

**Temp.:** Temperature results fall into the following broad categories. Nighttime temperatures are generally 10 to 20 degrees colder and may actually fall into the next colder cat￾egory (50% chance).

Hot: Between 30° and 44° F.

Warm: Temperatures between 16° and 30° F.

Moderate: Temperatures from 5° to 16° F.

Cold: Temperatures between -18° and 5° F.

Extreme Cold: Temperatures below -18° F.

Wind: The strength of the prevailing wind. Periods of calm or sudden stronger gusts are possible. Wind strength de￾creases one category at night (severe to strong, for example).

The three results on the Random Weather tables are fair, varies, and storm. Consult Table 12.

**TABLE 12: WIND STRENGTH**

| Fair   | Varies | Storm  | Strength       |
|--------|--------|--------|----------------|
| 01–70  | 01–40  | —      | Light/moderate |
| 71–95  | 41–70  | 01–10  | Strong         |
| 96–100 | 71–90  | 11–50  | Severe         |
| —      | 91–100 | 51–89  | Windstorm      |
| —      | —      | 90–100 | Hurricane      |

Wind effects are summarized on Table 3–17 in the DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide.

Precip.: The type of precipitation that falls during the day. A solid day of rain is pretty rare—even during heavy blizzards, clear spells hours long may appear.

**Clear:** No precipitation of note.

**Downpour:** 1d3 downpours lasting 1d4 hours each occur during the day. Otherwise, the day consists of rain.

**Fog:** There is a 75% chance that the fog burns off during the af￾ternoon, resulting in 1d4+2 hours of clear weather before sunset.

**Hail:** 1d3 hailstorms lasting 1d6×10 minutes each occur during the day. Otherwise the day consists of rain.

**Heavy Snow:** Heavy snow falls throughout the day, although 1d3–1 clear spells lasting 1d4 hours each break up the day.

**Rain:** Rain falls consistently throughout the day, although 1d4–1 clear spells lasting 1d4 hours each break up the day.

**Sandstorm:** Sandstorm conditions persist throughout the day, punctuated by 1d4–2 breaks lasting 1d4 hours each.

**Snow:** Snow falls steadily, but 1d4–1 clear breaks of 1d4 hours each interrupt the snowfall.

**Sleet:** Sleet falls for most of the day, broken by 1d4–2 breaks lasting 1d4 hours each.

**Thunderstorm:** 1d3 thunderstorms lasting 2d6×10 min￾utes each occur during the day. Otherwise the day is clear (50% chance) or rainy (50% chance).

# Bestiary changes

# MAGIC ITEMS

## Wearing Magic Items

In most cases, a magic item that’s meant to be worn will adjust its size to suit a creature regardless of the wearer’s gender or race. If you have a good reason for why a magic item shouldn’t fit, though, run with it. Armor made specifically by the self-absorbed drow might fit elves only. Dwarves might make items usable only by dwarf¬sized and dwarf-shaped characters to keep such items from being used against them. Such items should be exceptions, however, not the rule.

Use common sense to determine whether more than one of a given kind of magic item can be worn. Can a character wear two necklaces? Of course ! People in the real world wear multiple necklaces, amulets, medallions, and holy symbols at the same time, and there’s no prohibition against a character employing a necklace of fireballs while wearing an amulet of protection. Two belts? Sure, that’s easy to picture, perhaps with a weapon hanging from each one. But can a character wear two pairs of boots? No, that’s silly.

The simple rule is that a character can’t wear more than one pair of footwear (boots, sandals, slippers, and so on], more than one pair of gloves or gauntlets, more than one suit of armor, more than one cloak, or more than one item of headwear (a helmet, hat, circlet, crown, or similar item]. Feel free to impose other limits or grant exceptions where appropriate. For instance, a hat of disguise might allow the wearing of a mask or a circlet, but a character is unlikely to be able to wear two sets of bracers.

Items that are meant to function in pairs, including boots, bracers, gauntlets, and gloves, do not impart their benefits unless the entire pair is worn. A character can’t wear a boot of striding and springing on one foot and a boot of elvenkind on the other foot to use the properties of either or both magic items.

## Magic Item Attunement

Some magic items require a character to attune to them before the magical properties of those items can be enjoyed.

Attuning to a Magic Item: Attuning to a magic item requires that you first discover whether you can attune yourself to it. The identify spell is the most common way of discovering this fact. Unusual items magically reveal that fact to certain types of creatures or in certain circumstances.

The attunement process requires you to grasp or wear the item and spend 10 minutes concentrating on it. Depending on the nature of the item, this concentration can take the form of prayers, weapon practice, or meditation. In any case, the concentration period must be uninterrupted.

When you are attuned to an item, you can use any magical properties that require attunement. You also learn how to activate those abilities and any necessary command words or phrases to do so. See “Using a Magic Item” for different methods of magic item activation.
An item can be attuned to only one creature at a time. A magic item might require you to meet one or more prerequisites before you can become attuned to it.

## Using a Magic Item

Each magic item has one or more magical properties that it imparts to its user when properly held, wielded, or donned. How a user activates the item’s properties varies from item to item.

**Worn:** Many items must be worn to gain their benefits. A suit of armor must be donned, a shield strapped to the arm, a cloak fastened about the shoulders, a ring placed on a finger, and so on. Simply carrying around an item that’s meant to be worn is not sufficient to gain its benefits.

**Wielded:** Most magic weapon properties apply when the weapon is used in combat. A weapon might have properties that are useful when the item is drawn or held.

**Action Activated:** A magic item that falls into this category requires an action to activate. Potions, scrolls, and many wondrous items fall into this category.

Some item properties not only take an action to activate, but also require the item’s user to speak a command word or phrase. The command word or phrase must be spoken in an area where hearing is possible.

**Consumable:** Some magic items are used up when activated. Many consumable items are also action-activated items. Once activated, a consumable item loses its magic and no longer functions.

**Special Activations:** Sometimes a user must do something special to activate a magic item, as indicated in the magic item’s descriptive text.


### Magic armor +1

**Rare**

01-35	| Dragon leather
36-55	| Studded dragon leather
56-75	| Dragon scale

**Very rare**

01-40	| Mithral shirt
41-75	| Mithral scale
91-00	| Mithral plate

### Elven Chain

**Very rare magic armor (mithral shirt)**

Elven chain is exceptionally fine and light mithral chain mail, elaborately decorated with woven lines that twist like vines, and incorporating other precious metals, such as silver, gold, and platinum.

Donning the armor feels like slipping into a silk tunic, and the chain mail does not constrain the wearer’s movement. The magic woven into the elven chain enables the wearer to cast spells freely as well.

Mithral armor is usually made by dwarves, who mine the metal deep in the earth. Where dwarves and elves come together for trade or another common purpose, elven smiths craft fine shirts of the metal.

The elves guard elven chain jealously. In ancient times, they sometimes bestowed such armor on a dwarf who had earned their friendship, but generally it is meant for elves' use. A gift of such armor is a sign of deep respect.

**Property:** You can wear this armor as if you were proficient with it.

### Dagger of Venom

**Rare magic weapon (dagger)**

The black, obsidian blade of this weapon is serrated on one edge. Its pommel is carved to resemble two fanged serpents that twine together, their outstretched heads forming the blade’s quillon. Anyone wielding the blade notes a bitter, acrid scent from it.

A dagger of venom is most often crafted for the use of a yuan-ti or a powerful assassin. Each of these weapons has a distinct pattern to its blade or pommel that indicates its original owner. Assassins’ guilds and yuan-ti cults prize these blades as relics. If news of such a dagger reaches them, they send agents to collect the weapon by trickery or force.

**Property:** You gain a +1 bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls you make with this dagger. The saving throw DC of any poison you apply to the dagger increases by 2.

Once per day, you can use an action to cause thick, black poison to cover the dagger’s blade.

The poison remains for 1 minute or until you hit with an attack using this weapon. When you hit a living creature with this weapon while it’s coated in this poison, the creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it becomes paralyzed for 1 minute.

### Frost Brand

**Very rare magic weapon (long sword)**

The blade of this long sword is constantly rimed with frost and ice, and its hilt is wrapped in white leather. When it is drawn from its scabbard, nearby fires gutter, and a plume of condensing air steams from the weapon’s surface.

**Property:** You gain a +1 bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls you make with this weapon. On a hit with this weapon, you deal 1d6 extra cold damage.

While you have this sword drawn and in hand, you have fire resistance.

While drawn and in hand in freezing temperatures, the sword also sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for 10 feet beyond that.

Finally, once per hour, when you draw this weapon, you can choose to douse all nonmagical flames within 30 feet of you.

Wand of Binding

Rare magic wand

This wand is actually a length of chain held rigid by the magic that infuses it. The chain is crafted from adamantine, and runes of binding and imprisonment adorn each link.

Property [Attuned]: You must be a cleric, a druid, or a mage to become attuned to this item.

The wand has 7 charges. As an action, you can expend the specified number of charges to cast one of the following spells from the wand.

*	***hold person*** (2 charges]

*	***hold monster*** (6 charges]

If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand blackens and crumbles to dust, forever destroyed. The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges each day at dawn. In addition, while you hold the wand, you can expend a charge as a reaction whenever you make a saving throw to resist the hold person or the hold monster spell to gain advantage on your saving throw.

### Potion of Heroism

***Rare potion**

This colorless potion steams as if boiling.

Sampling or drinking it causes the imbiber to feel immensely healthy and robust.

**Property [Consumable]:** As an action, you drink the potion. You gain 10 temporary hit points. These hit points can cause you to exceed your hit point maximum, and they cannot be regained. If you take any damage, these hit points are lost first. In addition, you gain a +2 bonus to ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws. Finally, the saving throw DC of any spell you cast or magic item you use, or that results from something else you do by increases by 2.

The effects wear off after 1 hour.

### Ring of Wizardry
**Very rare ring**

Silver sigils of stars, comets, and suns are engraved on this bone ring.

Crafting a ring of wizardry involves several astounding feats of magic now lost to academic spellcasters. A mage must grow a clone, invest the clone with the knowledge of magic, and harvest a finger from it. From this finger’s bones a ring of wizardry is carved. A story exists about the “Nine-Fingered Mage,” a clone who escaped the complete ring-making process, but not soon enough to save every digit.

**Property (attuned):** If you are a wizard, add one to the number of spell slots you have for each level of spell you can cast up to 4th level.

### Cloak of Elvenkind
**Uncommon wondrous item**

This long cloak is fashioned from gray cloth, expertly crafted, and is half the weight of a normal cloak.

**An elf who sees a non-elf wearing a cloak of this sort might assume the cloak is stolen.** In some cases, however, cloaks of elvenkind are presented as gifts to the elves’ most trusted and valued allies.

**Property:** While you wear a cloak of elvenkind with the hood up, you can attempt to hide in any natural environment, as long as no creatures are within 20 feet of you. You do not have to be obscured to make the attempt, but you must stay quiet.

# Spells

Tracking the creatures is impossible except by magical means.


#### Prayer
3rd-level conjuration
Casting Time: Swift Range: 25 feet
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Choose any number of creatures within range. Until the spell ends, each target gains the blessing of the gods, manifested in a +1 bonus to AC, attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.

#### Spike Growth
2nd-level transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action Range: 100 feet Duration: 10 minutes
The ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point within range twists and sprouts hard spikes and thorns. The area becomes difficult terrain for the duration. When a creature moves through the area, it takes 2d4 piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels.
The transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look natural. Any creature that cannot see the area of the spell at the time the spell is cast must make a Wisdom (Perception] check against the spell’s saving throw DC to recognize the terrain as hazardous.

#### Barkskin

 now no longer requires concentration and reads as follows: “You touch a willing creature. The target’s skin takes on a rough, bark-like appearance for the spell’s duration, during which its AC becomes 16, if its AC is not already higher from wearing armor. The creature can benefit from wearing a shield as normal.”

#### Blade Ward 

now has a range of touch, granting the resistance to the creature you touch.
Chromatic Orb deals 4d8 damage, instead of 3d8.


#### Circle of Death

 now states that a creature reduced to 0 hit points by the spell’s damage is immediately killed.
A creature affected by Color Spray is both blinded and incapacitated.

#### Conjure Animals states that you can try to summon specific creatures, but the DM ultimately decides which creatures appear when you cast the spell. 

#### Conjure Barrage deals 6d8 damage, instead of 3d8.

Conjure Fey, Conjure Minor Elementals, and Conjure Woodland Beings state that you can try to > [!CAUTION]

Crown of Madness does not require you to use your action on subsequent turns to maintain control over the target.
Dancing Lights does not require concentration, but it ends early if you cast it again.
Elemental Weapon can affect magical weapons as well as nonmagical weapons. A magic weapon only gains the bonus to attack rolls if it does not already have a similar bonus to attack rolls. You can touch a creature’s natural weapons (such as its claws or teeth) to grant this benefit to that natural weapon, or you can touch a humanoid’s arms or legs to grant this benefit to the creature’s unarmed strikes. Finally, the spell’s damage dice are d8s, instead of d4s.
Instead of advantage, Enhance Ability grants a bonus on the given checks equal to the caster’s spellcasting ability modifier (minimum +2).
The damage bonus and penalty of Enlarge/Reduce is 1d6, instead of 1d4.
Ensnaring Strike deals 2d6 damage, instead of 1d6.
Enthrall does not allow a saving throw to resist its effects, but creatures immune to being charmed are immune to its effects.
Eyebite does not require concentration, instead lasting 1 minute.
When you cast Faerie Fire using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the dimensions of the cube increase by 10 feet for each slot level above 1st.
Find Traps now has a duration of up to 10 minutes, requiring concentration. You automatically know if there are any traps within 30 feet of you for the duration, and you can use an action to have specific, visible traps (both triggering and action mechanisms) glow in your vision. The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.
A creature reduced to 0 hit points by the damage of Finger of Death immediately dies.
Flame Blade’s description is replaced with the following:
You evoke a fiery blade in your free hand. This magic sword lasts until the spell ends. It counts as a simple melee weapon with which you are proficient. It deals 3d6 fire damage on a hit and has the finesse and light 
properties. You can use your spellcasting ability instead of your Strength or Dexterity for the weapon’s attack and damage rolls.
If you drop the weapon, it dissipates at the end of the turn. Thereafter, while the spell persists, you can use a bonus action to cause the sword to reappear in your hand.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd, to a maximum of 6d6.
Flame Strike deals 6d6 fire damage and 6d6 radiant damage, instead of 4d6 of each. When you cast the spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, both the fire damage and radiant damage increase by 1d6.
Friends now has a duration of up to 10 minutes.
When a creature takes psychic damage from Geas, its hit point maximum is reduced by the amount of psychic damage taken, to a minimum of 1. This reduction lasts until the spell ends.

Whenever a creature affected by Heroism rolls an attack roll or saving throw, it can roll a d4 add it to the result.
Inflict Wounds deals 4d10 damage, instead of 3d10.
If Lightning Bolt hits a solid surface made of wood, stone, or metal, it reflects off it at an angle equal and opposite the angle at which it hit, continuing to do so until its total length is 100 feet or until it has reflected 3 times. Each creature along any of its lengths becomes a target of the spell, though a creature cannot be targeted by the same lightning bolt more than once.
Magic Weapon can affect magical weapons as well as nonmagical weapons. A magical weapon only gains the bonus to attack and damage rolls if it does not already have such a bonus. You can touch a creature’s natural weapons (such as its claws or teeth) to grant this benefit to that natural weapon, or you can touch a humanoid’s arms or legs to grant this benefit to the creature’s unarmed strikes.
On a hit, Melfs Acid Arrow deals 6d4 damage, instead of 4d4.
Mordenkainen’s Sword deals 6d10 damage, instead of 3d10.
Pass Without Trace now specifies that a creature must be within 30 feet of you to benefit from its effects.
Phantasmal Force now specifies that the illusion created does not offer any physical resistance, even if the target thinks it’s real. It also deals 2d6 damage, instead of 1d6.
A creature reduced to 0 hit points by the damage of Phantasmal Killer immediately dies.
The third paragraph of Polymorph instead reads as follows: “The target gains a number of temporary hit points equal to the hit points of its new form. These temporary hit points can’t be replaced by temporary hit points from another source. A target reverts to its normal form when it has no more temporary hit points or it dies. If the spell ends before then, the creature loses all its temporary hit points and reverts to its normal form.”

#### Vampiric Touch


The damage dice of Vampiric Touch are d8s, instead of d6s.
When you cast Web using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the dimensions of the cube increase by 10 feet for each slot level above 2nd.
Witch Bolt requires a bonus action, not an action, to deal damage to the target after it is initially cast. Its range is 60 feet.

# Измерение времени - About time measurement

Gary Gygax said “YOU CANNOT HAVE A MEANINGFUL CAMPAIGN IF STRICT TIME RECORDS ARE NOT KEPT.“
 
I almost didn’t post this for fear of it being misused. Please don’t simply look up the parties travel pace below, determine what was found, mark off the time and move on. This is a role playing game after all. The following is intended as an aid in Dungeon Mastering a game, not as a substitute for it.
 
Time in a dungeon is measured in minutes – switching to 6 second rounds when there is an encounter.
 
The following is my interpretation of the official rules and a few of my house rules mixed in, presented here as advice to Dungeon Masters. Where I refer to “you”, I mean the DM. This is specifically for a dungeon crawls, but most of it applies to all similar situations. This is intended as a guide for tracking time passage in a dungeon and also for a guide in deciding when to use a character’s passive perception score or to roll a perception check.
 
The Dungeon Master describes what the PCs can see, hear, etc. Most of the time you can expect that the PCs are being observant so if they could notice something, they will notice it. So don’t wait for a player to say his character is examining the floor, or looking for footprints to tell them that there’s an obvious set of footprints on the floor in front of him. Players can ask questions or tell you what their PCs are going to do (or attempt to do). Players should never have to refer to skill names to do this. You decide if they need to roll an ability or skill check and which one. To keep the game moving at a reasonable pace, I recommend that you keep the die rolling to a minimum. If a player’s character would most likely notice something or recognize something or understand something based on his abilities and background, no roll is required. Just tell him.
 
The DM will roll all of the PCs search checks in secret and tell the players what, if anything, their characters found. That way, if they don’t find anything, they won’t know if there wasn’t anything there or if there was something and they didn’t find it. Another advantage of rolling behind your DM screen is that you can ignore the roll when necessary. If you want them to find something (or not find it), ignore the roll and tell them what they found (or that they didn’t find anything).
 
***Ask them for their marching order, but don’t ask if they are moving at a “fast pace”, “normal pace” or “slow pace”. That makes it sound too much like a computer game. Instead, simply ask them what they are doing. Use their answer to determine their pace and use that to help you determine how long it will take and what they do or do not notice.***
 
In addition to the fast pace, normal pace and slow pace listed in the Player’s Handbook, I have added a “very fast” pace and an ”extremely slow” pace.
 
Overview:
 
1. Moving at a very fast pace they automatically fail all perception checks. If they say “We are getting out of here as fast as we can” they are obviously not going to take the time to check for traps or secret doors so they are moving at a very fast pace (600 feet per minute).
 
2. Moving at a fast pace uses their passive perception scores with a -5 penalty. If they say “We are going to move through here as quickly as we can and still be on the lookout for traps”, you can say to yourself that that sounds like a fast pace (400 feet per minute).
 
3. Moving at a normal pace uses their passive perception scores. If they don’t give you any indication of how fast or cautiously they are moving through corridors, assume that they are moving at this pace. If they say “We are going to be watching for hidden monsters and checking for traps and secret doors as we proceed cautiously down the corridor”, you know that, even though this sounds like it might be a slow pace it is actually the normal way adventurers would explore a dungeon so it is a normal pace (300 feet per minute).
 
4. Moving at a slow pace they can be stealthy or search for things. If they don’t give you any indication of how fast they are searching a room, assume that they are moving at this pace. They make a Dexterity (Stealth) check if they are hiding or being stealthy. Make a Wisdom (Perception) check for them if they are searching for secret doors or traps. If not actively searching, they use their passive perception scores. If they say “We are trying not to be noticed as we proceed cautiously down the corridor” they are being stealthy and can only move at a slow pace (200 feet per minute).
 
5. Moving at an extremely slowly pace they will automatically find anything that can be found. If they say “We know there must be a secret door in this corridor, so we are going to search until we find it”, you know that they are going to keep looking until they find it if they can, so they are traveling at a extremely slow pace (30 feet per minute).
 
The times listed below are the suggested minimum times required. Additional time may be required depending on circumstances and PC actions. Anything found (secret doors, traps, treasures, and especially monsters) will add to the listed times below as they take the time to deal with what they have found.
 
* If they find a secret door they may then attempt to find a means to open it.
 
* I might have the searcher make an Intelligence (Investigation) check and subtract the results form 20 minutes for low long it takes. I will never let them find a secret door and never find out how to open it!
 
* If they find a trap they may then attempt to disarm or avoid it.
 
* It takes 5 minutes to disarm traps or pick a lock if proficient with thieves tools; 10 minutes otherwise. This assumes fairly straightforward mechanisms, not complex puzzles
 
* If they find a treasure they may then check it for traps.
 
 
Details:
 
Traversing corridors, stairs, and other passageways:
 
•When moving at a very fast pace (600 feet per minute), all attempts to notice any secret doors, hidden monsters or traps will fail. This speed is equivalent to the Dash action.
 
•When moving at a fast pace (400 feet per minute), passive Wisdom (Perception) scores, with a -5 penalty, will be used to see if they notice any secret doors, hidden monsters or traps.
 
•When moving at a normal pace (300 feet per minute), passive Wisdom (Perception) scores will be used to see if they notice any secret doors, hidden monsters or traps.
 
•When moving at a slow pace (200 feet per minute), the characters can attempt to hide or be stealthy. If hiding, Dexterity (Stealth) checks will be used against the Wisdom (Perception) checks of any monsters that are actively searching for them, and against the passive Wisdom (Perception) scores of any monsters that aren’t searching. Moving at this pace they can actively search for hidden doors or traps. Roll a Wisdom (Perception) check for the searchers and let them know if they found anything in this 200 foot length of corridor. Let the single roll be for detecting hidden doors and/or traps regardless of what they say they are searching for. Note that if they say they are being stealthy, but don’t express an interest in watching out for traps or finding secret doors, only roll Dexterity (Stealth) checks and use passive Wisdom (Perception) scores. Conversely, if they say that they are looking for traps, or secret doors but don’t seem interested in being stealthy, roll Wisdom (Perception) checks only.
 
•If the party intends to take as much time as required to thoroughly search a section of corridor, the party will be moving at an extremely slowly pace (30 feet per minute). This represents that the character is being extremely cautious and diligent in his searching. At this pace that character will automatically succeed at finding any secret doors, hidden monsters or traps that can be found by that character. [The DMG says “In some cases, a character is free to [retry a failed ability check]; the only real cost is the time it takes[…] To speed things up, assume that a character spending ten times the normal amount of time needed to complete a task automatically succeeds at that task.” This is the 5e equivalent to the 3.5e “Taking 20” rule.]
 
* One character can search the walls, floor and ceiling of a 5 foot wide passage, or one side of a wider passage out to 5 feet from the wall.
 
* 2 characters can cover a 10 foot wide passage.
 
* Characters that are searching can perform no other activities.
 
* Characters that are not searching can be on the lookout for monsters. For large parties they may need one lookout near the front and another one in the rear. If a monster approaches the group from a direction that is being watched, the Dexterity (Stealth) check of that character will be used against the Wisdom (Perception) checks of any monsters that are actively searching for them, and against the passive Wisdom (Perception) scores of any monsters that aren’t searching.
 
### Searching a Room:
 
If the party opens a door but doesn’t enter a room and only observes it from the doorway it doesn’t take any additional time to be able to map its location and general notes about it, but not its exact size or anything about the room that cannot be quickly seen. A detailed description will require that the party enters the room.
 
After they enter the room, describe what they see and ask what each character is doing. Describe the results of their activities. If they say “I am searching the room”. Don’t ask “What are you searching for?” rather say something like “What does searching the room look like? Describe exactly what your character is doing.” If they say “I am looking for secret doors.” Don’t ask which 5 foot section of wall he is searching, rather assume he will search all of the walls and use the travel paces descried below to determine his success or failure. If it makes a difference, or if you simply want him to think it might, you could ask where he is starting his search and which direction he will be searching from there. A room can be memorable and fun if you can get them to describe how they are interacting with the objects in the room.
 
The party may have a different travel pace for rooms than it does for corridors. Their pace may change in a room if they discover something interesting (or dangerous) but I wouldn’t normally mark off more than 10 minutes per room unless they slow to an extremely slow pace. Your players should be able to search as much as they want. Just warn them of the consequences (time passing, wandering monsters, etc.) ahead of time.
 
How pace of travel effects checking out rooms:
 
•Very fast pace (600 feet per minute – measured from entrance to exit by the shortest path). Treat these rooms like corridors. They are almost running through the rooms and won’t notice anything much more than their size and location. They automatically fail all perception checks. They will be surprised by any monsters waiting for them. They may surprise monsters that aren’t expecting them.
 
•Fast pace (1 minute per room). They are mostly just passing through. They can note what is in the room, its size, number and location of its exits. The Passive Wisdom (Perception) scores of the searchers, with a -5 penalty, will be used to see if they notice any secret doors, hidden monsters or traps. They are moving through the room too fast to search for any hidden treasure but will notice things that are in plain sight.
 
•Normal pace (5 minutes per room). Use this pace if they want to search the room but want to be quick about it. The passive Wisdom (Perception) scores of the searchers will be used to see if they notice any secret doors, hidden monsters or traps. At this pace they can make a quick search for hidden treasure at a disadvantage using their Wisdom (Perception) scores.
 
•Slow pace (10 minutes per room). Use this pace if they don’t give you any other indication of how fast they are searching a room. Use this pace if they want to loot the room, or if they want to be stealthy. Roll the Wisdom (Perception) checks of the searchers to see if they notice any secret doors, hidden monsters, hidden treasure or traps. If they are being stealthy, their Dexterity (Stealth) checks will be used against the Wisdom (Perception) checks of any monsters that are in the room or that enter the room and that are watching for them, and against the passive Wisdom (Perception) scores of any monsters that aren’t.
 
•Extremely slowly pace (1 hour per room). At this pace they can carefully examine every inch of the room. At this pace they will automatically succeed at finding any secret doors, hidden monsters, hidden treasure or traps that can be found by their characters. If there is something in the room that they wouldn’t be able to find even if they rolled a 20 on an ability check and added all of their bonuses, it is beyond their ability to find so it will remain hidden.
 
•The times above represent at least 2 characters searching.
 
•Two characters can search the walls, floor and ceiling and everything inside of a room up to 30’ x 30’. Larger rooms, or rooms with a large amount of “stuff” may take longer. Rooms smaller than 30’ x 30’ still take the indicated time to search.
 
•A single character searching the same room will take twice as long.
 
•More than two characters searching the room do not reduce the time any further unless it is a very large room.
 
•Characters that are searching can perform no other activities.
 
•Characters that are not searching can be on the lookout for monsters. One character can watch only one entrance without penalty. If a monster approaches the group through an entrance that is being watched, the Dexterity (Stealth) check of that character will be used against the Wisdom (Perception) checks of any monsters that are actively searching for you, and against the passive Wisdom (Perception) scores of any monsters that aren’t searching.

# TRAPS
MAGICAL TRAPS
These traps are arcane in nature, radiating an aura that is perceivable by those trained in it. Be careful with these, as most of them are invisible to the naked eye. Magical traps can be further broken down into various classes - glyphs, proximity, or situational
Glyphs are written with a special ink or are magically carved into an object, as that upon facing closely to the glyph will activate it. Proximity magical traps activate only when a creature, or perhaps certain creatures get within range of it, like an elf getting too close to a sword. Situational magical traps activate whenever you do something specific, such as opening a chest.
GLYPH TRAPS
Detecting one of these types of traps is difficult, but you can sense them with a find trap spell or enhancing your eyes to truesight. If a special ink is used, wiping it away will not deactivate it. Some sort of residue remover will work wonders, but again it depends on the type of ink.
 
Engraved glyphs are a little harder to work with.
Depending on the type, simply slicing through the glyph will be enough to destroy it. I've seen some where it was carved into an adamantine door!
ATTRACTION GLYPH
Now I know what you're thinking. How can falling in love be a trap? Well have you ever heard of marriage? Exactly. Well, this has nothing to do with love at all, but rather metallic items being stuck to the glyph itself. Its a bit of a problem when the key you need gets pulled out of your hands onto the other side of a lava pit!
Whenever this activates, any metallic items within 15 feet of it is pulled toward the center of the glyph, at a speed of 30 feet per turn. A Strength saving throw is required to hold onto the items. If a creature is wearing armor that mostly consists of metal and weighs under 200 pounds fails their saving throw, they are attracted to the glyph. Once on it, the creature is prone and restricted.
FLASH GLYPH
One of the many glyphs that can be found is the Flash glyph. Whenever this activates, any creature within 10 feet of it has their vision disoriented. A Constitution saving throw must be made, with creatures that fail being blinded for 1 minute.
No damage is done from this type of trap, but it sure is annoying when you find an ancient grimoire and this is in the middle of the book!
LEECH GLYPH
Oh, this is a bugger! Ever had your magical ability removed from you before? Don't ever do it. This is one of the few things that can take it from you. Whenever this activates, any creature within 10 feet of it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature cannot use any magical spells or spell-like abilities for 1 minute. Magical items within this radius are also considered nonmagical for the duration.
One time, we were trying to run from this pack of owlbears in an abandoned dungeon, right? Well I won't point out any names, but someone (Aoth Rein) stepped on this which was on the ground. Well we got trapped in a dead end, cornered by these beasts. Let me tell you, that was not fun! 
PARANOIA GLYPH
How could I forget this one? Oh, I messed up big time when I touched this. I became afraid of mice! Mice! Do you know how embarrassing it is, when you've delved deeper than any person before, have talked dragons out of burning villages, and conversed with unfathomable horrors?
Whenever this activates, all creatures within 10 feet of it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature becomes afraid of harmless things around it, overthinking any possible situation, and grows untrust among the party. This effect lasts for ldlO minutes.
STASIS GLYPH
This one is a pain! Being affected by this can certainly cause many problems, as once you're caught, you can't move! Whenever this activates, any creature within 5 feet of it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature is paralyzed for 1 minute.
This is another glyph that doesn't do any damage by itself, but I have heard about these being used with falling ceilings that slowly make their way down. People go splat under pressure; did you know that?
PROXIMITY TRAPS
How can someone deactivate a trap that triggers when you get too close? The answer is that you don't, honestly. What you should do is instead cause some motion to activate it, such as throwing some pebbles or letting loose a live rat. Or, you can make the big, bully guy go in first to activate it. I'm not judging! Without doing so, well.. You can say good-bye to the world
These traps are very difficult to find and not for the faint of heart either. They activate whenever a creature gets within sight or within range. Some examples of this the arcane eye which sees out in a line, or the clairvoyance spell in which someone gets within a certain distance. On top of that, darkvision placed on a trap can sense creatures in the dark, out to 60 feet in order to trigger the spell Lastly, a see invisibility spell can be cast, or a true sight spell so they can see if you are hidden, or if you're on a different plane of existence!
ALARM
Widely known as a spell already, this is famous for protecting objects that you want out of other people's hands. The alarm spell is casted on an object, and when you do cast it, you can select a number of people that can interact with the object without setting off the alarm. In addition, you can make the alarm heard to all, or just the people you select in their mind!
Salazar Basha and I went into a crypt of ooze covered skeletons, and found a sword that had not rusted throughout the ages. It was in the hand of a king on a throne, now entirely skeleton. As soon as we touched it, the skeletons made a dead sprint towards us! Get it? Dead sprint9 Hey, I never said my jokes were funny.
 
COMBUSTING SUCK SPIKES
This, this one is a mighty danger. It starts off just as a simple ascension or descension on a stone floor. All of a sudden, the stone is covered in a thick layer of grease, risking you fall prone and slide to the bottom. As if that wasn't bad enough, a flame lights the grease, so if you aren't falling, you'll be caught on fire! Additionally, if you are sliding, there are spikes that form at the bottom of the hallway! If I had to recall on it, I would say the spells are grease, produce flame and perhaps spike growth...
Stay away from this one!
HUNGRY ARMS
As soon as you enter the area, tentacles of unknown horror tear through the air, lashing out at anyone unfortunate enough to be near. Upon further inspection, I have found that the spell must be arms ofhadar, an unfathomable beast from the Far Realms.
ILLUMINATING PRESENCE
This one is not so much a trap, but can startle you at first! Whenever you come within range of an object, it brightens a few torches so that you may see! I have identified what actually activates, and it seems to be the dancing lights cantrip. The first time I saw this, I was walking into an ancient keep of a lost civilization, where the torches would emit light along the hallway.
MISSILES IN THE DARK
With the ability of seeing out in darkness, this magical trap will fire 3 magic missiles, automatically hitting any creature it sees fit. This is quite dangerous, as I've lost many an ally when we were first travelling out in search of fortune.
MOLTEN METAL
Quite an awful trick, I will admit. As soon as you enter the room, the walls and floor are made of metal But after a few seconds, the metal changes from a cold, dark color to a heated yellow and red! You will realize that the room is going to bum you alive if you don't get out! That must have been a heat metal spell..
RADIATING WEAPONS
Have you seen a bright flash of light, only to realize that it is a weapon? Some traps will conjure one of these weapons. I've seen swords, spears and even maces become real! It must have been a spiritual weapon spell that was cast, I'm confident that it was. That reminds me of the time I went into the burial grounds full of heroes, where we were searching for Dothan Sabrina, a famous paladin...
SITUATIONAL TRAPS
These traps are triggered by really specific conditions, such as being an elf and walking into the room, or being the age of 347. Another trigger can be that you simply interacting with something, which is veiy complicated unless you know exactly what you are doing. Stay safe! 
COMPACT HALLWAY
Imagine that the hall you are walking down gets closer and tighter, to the point that you can't budge forward How would you get through? Corporal Redbloom found out the hard way...
In order to truly disable this magical hallway, you have to keep travelling in, to the point that you are stuck and cannot even back out. Once you do, you will soon realize that the hallway was just an illusion! It was really just as big as normal!
FORGE OF GEMS
Can you believe that Father Time actually exists? If you don't believe me, well I have news for you. I met him! Actually, that is sort of why I am mentioning this trap now...
An efreeti forge, crafted in the City of Brass, made out of the very same metaL In it is a fire that flickers softly, but gives no heat. Upon further investigation, the charcoal is actually small rubies. Simply taking from the forge is what leads to your demise, though... Attempting to take a gem will require a Dexterity saving throw, as a fireball centered from the mouth of the forge is released
If you instead drop a gem into the forge, the spirits of the efreeti manifest, blessing you with resistance to fire damage.
MANIFESTED MIRROR
I wouldn't call this one a trap, but rather a difficult one to process. So mirrors reflect things back into out eyes, correct? Well, this mirror reflects the semi-truth into the gazer. Objects that are hidden in the room, such as secret doors are revealed in the room, but may not be interacted with.
So how do you use that mirror then? Well, you have to go through it. The only difficulty is that your reflection blacks your path. Creatures that don't have a reflect, such as vampires, can freely enter and exit at their will
ROGUE'S BANE
Some traps are designed for certain... Professions. A small gearbox often is connected to a mechanical trap, and the trap disabler will do their job. But what happens when they do their job, but that is what causes the activation?
In times like this, the disabled device actually triggers the magic to take effect. I've seen it where doors lock because of this, or poisonous gas clouds the room.
TELEPORTATION ROOM
Entering this room will lead you to different chambers, in which you will be unfamiliar with. As soon as the magically rigged item is interacted with, all doors slam shut, and once opened will reveal that the halls outside look much different. Why? Because the characters themselves had their entire room teleport over to a new location.
I remember one time, we were exploring this location called the Tomb of Vrouk'zous the Foul in the Underdark. We slipped into one room, where a chest lay in the center. Well, the rogue searched it in it's entirely for traps, but couldn't find any! As soon as it was opened, we all lurched backwards, landed on our butts and the doors locked shut! As soon as I felt I was done spinning, I opened the door to get out and I didn't recognize anything!
 
MECHANICAL TRAPS
Mechanical traps vary widely, being able to controlled from an input device, such as a pressure plate or trip wire, all the way to being carved into something such as a pit trap. As such, I have organized these into input devices, as most pit traps are common knowledge.
INPUT DEVICES
Input devices are what needs to be tampered with in order to activate the trap itself. Things such as a trip wire being broken or a light source having a shadow casted are examples.
What is great about these traps is that they are easily created, requiring minimal set up time and can be taken down for transport. On the other hand, being taken down is a way to lose the trap itself from sticky fingers.
DOOR HINGE
Simply opening a door will trigger a trap. You can do so by having objects attached to the top of the door to tip, or place a trip wire in the hinge so that it will be cut when opened
LIGHT INTERRUPTION
A light source that is constant may look like an ordinary torch, but having a small sensor that picks up the light across the room is a wonderous little item. Whenever the light no longer shines on the sensor, its switch will activate, releasing the trap. These are near impossible to detect, as getting close to it may cast your shadow on it, and the trap will trigger.
NOISE MAKER
This isn't so much an input device but more to keep you aware of their presence. Simply hanging many chains in a hallway can do so, as it will be difficult to pass without bumping into them. Another way to do so is have a bell attached to a door, so that when it opens, it will ring out.
PRESSURE PLATE
A weight sensitive tile or plate has a switch underneath, which can snip a long trip wire or the like. Simply pushing on the pressure plate with a pole will click the switch, which can activate the trap.
TRIPWIRE
Made of fishing line or even heavy duty hempen rope, whenever the line is broken or pulled tight, the release will occur. Unfortunately, these can be simply cut from far away, as long as you can spot them!
NATURE TRAPS
Finally, the wilderness has many, many harmful plants and such that exploring may prove more dangerous than you can handle. Jungles are filled with poisonous plants, rivers may be flooded with sinking mud, boulders may fall from cliff sides. 
Be aware of your surroundings! Always pay attention to what is around you. Don't try to be a hero, and don't be a fool You cannot save anyone or get treasure if you don't even make it to your destination!
ARCANE STORM
Arcane weather tampering is an impressive feat, but also a costly one. With the arcane power still infused with the clouds, the storm will eventually head away, only to bring a different destruction. When this storm occurs, the rain causes damage. Anyone caught in its rain must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes ld6 force damage. This saving throw must be repeated at the start of every round On a successful saving throw, the creature takes half damage.
This location that the storm is in is considered a pocket of wild magic. Any spell casted within this area must have a percentile dice roll, following the Wild Surge Table on page 104 in the Player's Handbook.
This storm lasts for ld4 hours.
HOT PIT
Sometimes, the world around us is full wonder and danger, which captivates me. Once such instance is what I call the hot pit, where massive ponds and lakes instantly heat to the point that they boil When this occurs, you need to get out right away, as many people who wander into a hot pit receive bums, if they make it at all!
With a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Survival) check, you can tell the symptoms of a hot pit about to heat up. Roughly 30 seconds before the heat starts, the water clouds to a deep gray, with the heavy smell of salt that hangs in the air. 15 seconds before the heat begins, the water slowly shakes, rippling on the surface.
All those caught in the water must make a Constitution saving throw, with the DC set at 16. On a failure, the creature takes 4d6 fire damage as the water scalds you, and a level of exhaustion. At the start of every turn, any creature in the water receives an additional 4d6 fire damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage for the round that the saving throw occurs.
Flying creatures within 80 feet above the hot pit must also make the Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 4d6 fire damage, one level of exhaustion and are falling at a rate of 60 feet per turn.
Once 5 rounds have occurred, the water settles down, and instantly cools.
JAWS OF DOOM
We all know the little tiny plants that eat common pests, correct? Jaws of Doom are similar plants, but on a much more massive scale. Their aroma entices many, where it smells of cooking meat with garlic spice. They look like wide, flat bushes with brown fur on top that takes up a 10 foot space, appearing like mold Because of this, many lost adventurers looking for food will wander over, stepping on top of the plant, and be swallowed up, slowly dissolved
Whenever a creature steps on the plant, they must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the plant springs up and swallows the creature. The creature is grappled and can make a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to break free at the end of its turn. A grappled creature takes 2d6 acid damage at the start of their turn.
 
A creature can recognize the plant with a DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) or Intelligence (Nature) check.
SWAMP ROT
Deep in the swamps, a mist consumes the land during the night. For some strange reason, the mist stays around 10 feet away from any fire source, but will spread around it. If a creature breathes in the mist at any moment, the creature must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. The symptoms do not show up until ld8 hours later.
On a failure, the creature's hit point maximum is reduced by their Constitution modifier per day. If the saving throw is failed by 5 or more, the creature also gains a level of exhaustion. This level of exhaustion does not reduce by taking a long rest. On a successful saving throw, the creature cannot be affected by swamp rot for 24 hours.
Being affected by another cause of swamp rot will require another Constitution saving throw. Additional failures have their penalties stack.
After ld4 days, the symptoms go away and are no longer affected by swamp rot. A lesser restoration or similar spell will remove this disease.
VINE FLOORING
The floor of a jungle has winding layer of vines, but sometimes that is the only thing for flooring, giving a false sense of security. A successful DC 17 Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Survival) check will allow the person to notice that there is no ground underneath. Any creature over 50 pounds that steps on the vines must make a Dexterity saving throw, with the DC set at 15. On a failure, the creature falls 10 feet but is restrained, hanging over the pit or cliffside below them. On a success, the creature holds their footing.
INKTABLE
Ink	Application DC
Rust Powder	10
Squid Ink	11
Coodberry Juice	12
Oak Tree Water	1 3
Humanoid Blood	14
Basilisk Venom	1 5
Crushed White Scale Paste	16
Wyvern Poison	17
Purple Worm Poison	18

SPECIAL INKS
Special inks can be harvested and used for different glyphs. Each special ink has difficulty being wiped and cleaned away, unless a specific remover is applied to it, or a procedure happens.
It seems the rarer and more valuable the ink used, the riskier the ink is, as it may decay or fall apart. Down below is an Ink Table that tells the cost of the ink and the DC of creating the glyph. Whenever you apply the ink, you must make a Dexterity (Painter's Tools) check.
BASIUSK VENOM
How could you possibly harvest this at all? It is incredibly difficult to survive a basilisk attack, but to render it unable to fight and then get the venom without getting cut at all? That is some serious talent. The only thing that I know of that would get rid of basilisk venom is goat milk. Basilisk venom costs 500 gp per vial
CRUSHED WHITE SCALE PASTE
The process of grinding white dragon scales is a labor intensive one, where many hours can be spent. At the end of it, you have a substance that seems as a mixture between chalk and flour. Stirring this powder into a small vial of water creates a paste that can be applied One of the few things that removes white scale paste is an open flame applied to it. One vial of this paste costs as much as 300 gp.
GOODBERRY JUICE
Made from goodberries that have been pulverized in a pestle and mortar, this can easy be applied but dries veiy quickly. Because of its rich red color, it is also often used to dye clothing. Goodberry juice seems to wash away with oil, oddly enough. You can get a flask of goodberry juice for 5 gp.
HUMANOID BLOOD
If you are in desperate need, you can slice open your own hand and draw with the blood if need be. I won't judge, I have also been put into that same position! A simple wash rag can wipe away the blood though.
OAK TREE WATER
Water that is found in the trunk of a mighty oak can be gathered easily, if you tap into it. Unfortunately, mighty oaks are usually in groves, protected by druid circles to prevent harm. This clear liquid applies just like any other water, and dries with a clear, wax-like residue. The only way to really get rid of oak tree water is with anything that has a high alcohol content. A vial of oak tree water goes for around the price of 30 gp.
PURPLE WORM POISON
Purple worms are massive, burrowing earth worms that of course, are the purple variety. Their poison is so deadly that single drops can kill a humanoid instantly. To gather any of this poison, now that is an adventure in itself! Being that it burrows, it only makes sense that rock will absorb and neutralize this poison. A single vial of purple worm poison goes as high as 2,000 gp!
 
RUST POWDER
Old swords and armor are usually junk, as their rusted dull edge is in too bad of a condition. If this rust is gathered and suspended in water, it can easily be applied to a surface. To get rid of use, it seems that a splash of acid will remove it, but the acid might also eat away at the surface. Rust powder can be purchased for about 5 gp, but most smiths will give it away for free.
SQ,UID INK
Squid ink is plentiful in the world without much trouble to get, especially on the coast! Head to your nearest fish market in port, and I'm sure you can gather quite a bit! Squid ink can easily be removed by wiping it away with a wet cloth. Ajar of ink which is one ounce, costs only 10 gp. What a steal!
WYVERN POISON
An incredible feat in itself is to survive seeing a wyvern. It is another to gather the poison of a wyvern and apply it. Personally, I have only heard tales of such, and never personally done it. One of the few things that neutralize wyvern poison is the plant called Wyvern's Bane, which grows on certain mountain ranges. Wyvern venom costs 1,200 gp per vial
CREATING TRAPS
So you want to learn the art of trapmaking, huh? It is an interesting topic, but I can teach you. Down below are some notes I have jotted down in order to further your knowledge!
MAGICAL TRAP CREATION
In order to create a magical trap, you need to come up with the way that the device will activate, either from glyphs or proximity. Use the following Arcane Spell Activation table in order to find the cost of the activation. If it is a spell, you must spend the spell slot and any additional material component costs.
The Perception DC is to check against a creature that is hidden from a Dexterity (Stealth) check. If a creature is not hiding, the spell automatically succeeds in finding the creature.
If it is a glyph, use the Glyph Spell Activation table below in order to find the difficulty in creating it on certain objects. This difficulty is represented by a DC, which is made by a Dexterity (Woodcarver's Tools) Dexterity (Mason's Tools) or Dexterity (Smith's Tools) If the glyph is made of ink, you must pay the cost of the ink, found in the Special Inks section.

DC FOR SAVES AND DISARMING
Once you have established the activation requirements or drawn or carved the glyph, you can now imbue some magic into the object.
The requirements to do so are shown by spell slots, giving a DC for the trap to save against the spell or glyph. Glyphs themselves require a spell slot to infuse the arcane energy into it, which you can select in order to get the appropriate DC.
GLYPH SPELL ACTIVATION
Material	DC	Time
Wood	10	1 Minute
Stone	14	10 minutes
Iron	16	1 Hour
Another Metal	18	2 Hours
Adamantine	20	4 Hours


When you use a spell slot, you can select a spell that you wish the trap to cast when activated. When doing so, you must expend material component costs if the spell requires to. Spells that have a range will be firing at the creature that triggers the trap. If a spell is touch based, then the spell triggers whenever a creature touches the object. If the spell requires a saving throw and has an area, treat the object like the center of the spell for calculating the spell
In addition, there is a DC to disarm the arcane trap or glyph without setting it off, which can be done with an Intelligence (Arcana) check.


MECHANICAL TRAP CREATION
Not everyone can cast spells which is just as fine, but with some simple ingenuity, a person with some time on their hands can be a valuable assett when it comes to this. There are a few steps that must be taken, but be warned that most traps may need reset.
The input device is often hidden, which is shown by the Stealth DC on the Mechanical Input Device table. This is contested by a character's Wisdom (Perception) check.
Next to that is the Disable DC column, where it is the DC required to disable the input device with a Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) check.
After that is the Set Up Time column. This is the amount of time it takes to put together one of these traps that use this input device.
Lastly is the Reset column. Whenever your trap activates, it may be possible for the trap to automatically reset itself, or you may need to manually set it again



MECHANICAL INPUT DEVICE
Activation	Stealth DC	Disable DC	Set Up Time	Reset
Noise Maker	10	10	1 Minute	Automatic
Trip Wire	14	12	1 Minute	Manual
Door Hinge	16	1 5	3 Minutes	Depends
Pressure Plate	19	1 5	10 Minutes	Depends
Light Interruption	25	20	30 Minutes	Depends



LANGUAGE BARRIERS
Sometimes, a character does not know a language that is spoken in front of them. A character might attempt to understand the language, or recall a few words that they might have heard before. The creature must make an Intelligence (History) check. The DC is 15 for a standard language, or 20 for an exotic language.
On a success, the creature can understand one or two key words that the creature had said
LONG REST TO LEVEL UP
Whenever a character has enough experience to increase their level, the character must finish a long rest to increase their level This will prevent the level increase in a hostile environment.
LICHDOM ASCENSION 

 

o live forever is the dream of many people. You would never worry about the ever present threat of death. The closest that most mortals can be to immortal is being an elf, as they have the ability to live a long life of near 750 years. Another way is through powerful artifacts, one of which is the Ring of Winter, rumored to be on Artus Cimber. Lastly, you could live forever by dying, and coming back as an undead monstrosity. Two forms of this undeath can be found - lichdom or vampirism. In this chapter, I will go over how to become the undead spellcaster, known as a lich.
LICHES AND THEIR LICHDOM
A lich is a supremely powerful arcane spellcaster, and are almost always eviL An exception to this is the baelnom, which are elves that undergo this transformation in order to protect their community.
Liches don't exactly live, but merely exist. This occurs when a wizard or sorcerer seal their soul into an object known as a phylactery. This is no easy task - binding your soul to an object takes a heavy toll on the body, and has a risk of permanently destroying the item, or worse.
After the phylactery has received the soul, the phylactery will require additional souls to consume. Without a consistent source of souls to feed off of, the phylactery will eventually consume the liches soul, then destroy itself. Without their soul, a lich will be destroyed
To be a lich is almost a certain malignant fate. What makes a person humane is their soul Without that, they are merely a selfish husk of a body, free to do whatever they please. With an eternity to live forever, a liches scheme may take centuries to come into fruition. What you choose to do with your time and research is up to you, but be aware that those who side with goodness may hunt you down.
LICHDOM PREREQUISITES
To begin the path of lichdom, the aspiring spellcaster must be able to cast at least 6th level spells. The source of magic does not matter, although clerics of righteous deities may find their ability to cast magic taken.
 
After the spellcaster has gained the ability to cast a 6th level spell or higher, they must find the dark ritual The knowledge is a well-guarded secret, where only those worthy may find it. Perhaps the ritual must be bargained for by Orcus, or a warlock may receive it from their ancient patron.
This ritual is split into multiple parts. It is incredibly rare to find all components to the ritual at once in one central location, although it is possible. Without all parts, it is impossible to complete the ritual
After completion of the ritual it is not a guarantee that the spellcaster becomes a lich. Permanent death is always a possibility, or even a loss of a sense. If successful the spellcaster will awaken a few days later, enjoying their new unlife, as long as they continuously supply the phylactery with souls, and keep it safe.
CREATING THE PHYLACTERY
The phylactery is the object that holds the soul allowing the body to progress in age, but not die. If a liches body is destroyed, the phylactery will emit a wafting dark smoke, reforming the liches body over the course of a few days.
A spellcaster cannot purchase an item to use as a phylactery. Instead, they must craft an item of their choice. The cost of creating this phylactery must be at least 50,000 gp worth of materials, and must use one drop of their fresh blood every day in the process. Doing do will allow the phylactery to know which soul to preserve.
In order to craft the phylactery, the spellcaster must succeed on a DC 25 Smith's Tools or Tinker's Tools check.
On a failure of 21 to 24, the crafting of the phylactery will take an additional year for every number the check had failed by. If the check failure is by 5 or greater, the phylactery crafting is unsuccessful
After the phylactery has been successfully created, it must be inscribed with arcane sigils. To do so, the spellcaster must mark the phylactery with at least 5,000 gp of silver.
Upon completion of the arcane sigils, the spellcaster is mentally linked to their phylactery. In addition, they can see their phylactery as if they had cast scrying, without expending a spell slot. 
Your phylactery has the following statistics:
•	The phylactery has an AC of 10.
•	The phylactery has 25 HP.
•	The phylactery has resistance to all damage except force damage.
•	The phylactery loses one hit point per day that it does not have a soul to feed on. If its hit points reaches 0, it will be destroyed, along with the soul of the lich.
As long as the liches phylactery remains, the lich can have their body reform after ldlO days. If a lich does not have a phylactery, they can spend their time performing the same ritual to create their phylactery. If the lich does not have a phylactery whenever their body is destroyed, both their body and soul are consumed by the ShadowfelL Only divine intervention can restore a lich in this way.
SOUL ACQUISITION
After the phylactery has been created, and the silver sigils have been inscribed, it is ready to receive the spellcasters soul The phylactery will remain open for 10 days. Without acquiring a soul, it will close off and must be reattempted again.
In order to allow the phylactery to receive your soul you must make a DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check. On a success, the soul is open to receive the soul
On a failure of 16 to 19, the phylactery remains closed and will not accept a soul and must be attempted after one day has passed On a failure of 11 to 15, the phylactery will remain closed off from accepting souls for ten days. On a failure of 10 or lower, the phylactery is destroyed
THE FOUL POTION
Once the phylactery has been completed the next step is to create the vile poison that the spellcaster will consume. This poison is an unholy matrimony of life and death - the physical representation of undeath.
This concoction is made of numerous abominations. It must be consumed during the ritual in order to convert into a lich. This process is almost certain to kill whoever drinks it, and is the likely cause of loss in a liches senses.
In order to create this poison, you must use at least five of the following ingredients below:
A vial of wyvem blood A vial of manticore venom A vial of an elder brain's brine A vial of roper saliva A vial of gorgon blood A vial of purple wurm poison A gram of crushed and dried belladonna A gram of rot grub eggs A gram of unicorn horn powder A drop of gelatinous cube acid A ghoul's finger nail A couatl's feather
The heart of a good-aligned humanoid The humanoid must have been sacrificed within the past day. The heart is used as the container of the poison, and must be consumed after drinking the poison in order to be used as an ingredient.
 
THE ASCENSION RITUAL
Finally, when the phylactery is able to receive souls, and the potion is consumed can the ritual begin. The ritual consists of an area that is high in magical concentration. Examples of this may be in a wizard's tower, or an area of faerzress in the Underdark.
This area must be prepared with sigils of binding, written in your blood To do so, you must succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check. On a failure, the sigils must be removed and reapplied the next day. In the center of the arcane sigils must be the phylactery.
Once the sigils are complete and the check is a success, the runes will begin to glow with an eerie green. The glowing will continue for one minute, afterwards it will require another application of blood on the next day.
During the glowing, the thick, black ooze of the poison will also glow the same green. The poison must be consumed within the minute of the arcane markings beginning to glow. Failure to consume all of the poison before the glowing ends will result in a 50% chance of entering a coma for ld6+l days, or immediate death without transforming into a lich.
If the spellcaster successfully consumes the poison within the minute, roll on the Success to Drink Table. If the ritual was under the light of a full moon, or during a new moon, add 10 to the roll For each additional ingredient in the poison after the first five, add an additional 5 to the roll

S'
 

-Vwvf.. 
IMMEDIATE DEATH
Upon consumption of the poison, the drinker is immediately killed within 5 rounds. During this time, the phylactery will attempt to retrieve the soul before it goes to the afterlife.
If the roll determined that it was a failure, the soul passes onto the afterlife, determined by the spellcaster's alignment. Due to the horrendous acts that the spellcaster did during the ritual, they are most likely not of good-alignment.
If the roll determined that the death led to a successful retrieval of the soul, the spellcaster awakens as a light at the next dawn.
COMA
Upon consumption of the poison, the drinker falls into a coma within 5 rounds. During this time, the phylactery will attempt to steal the soul of the spellcaster, ripping it from the unconscious body.
The spellcaster is unconscious for ld6+l days. No magical spells can reverse this effect. If the roll determined a failure, the spellcaster will awaken without being transformed into a lich.
If the roll determined a success, then the spellcaster will awaken, transformed into a lich.
PERMANENT HANDICAP
Upon consumption of the poison, the drinker falls into a coma within 5 rounds. During this time, the phylactery will attempt to steal the soul of the the spellcaster. The combination of ripping the soul out of the body and the foul nature of the poison will permanently affect the lich.
The spellcaster will awaken within Ы6+1 days. In addition, roll on the Permanent Handicap Table.
PERMANENT HANDICAP
ld4 Outcome
1	The lich is mute
2	The lich is paralyzed in their hands
3	The lich is deafened
4	The lich is blinded
 
BEING A LICH
As a lich, you gain the following properties:
•	You are an Undead humanoid
•	You have advantage against any effect that turns undead
•	Your phylactery will create another body for you within ldlO days if your body is destroyed
•	You can make one melee spell attack against a creature. The creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or be paralyzed for one minute. The creature can repeat this saving throw at end of each of its turns, ending the effect.
During your time as a lich, you must feed your phylactery souls in order to maintain its state. To do this, the phylactery will automatically retrieve souls by any creature that has died within 300 feet of it. The phylactery will feed on the soul for a number of weeks, equal to the creature's CR.
LEGENDARY AND LAIR ACTIONS
Normally, liches found elsewhere would have lair actions and legendary actions. This takes many decades at the very least to obtain the ability to do this! Due the becoming a lich recently, you do not have the ability to use lair or legendary actions at this time.
