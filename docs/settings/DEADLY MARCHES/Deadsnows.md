# Отдых и восстановление

## Длинный отдых

Длинный отдых - 8 часов в безопасных условиях (тайной стоянке или поселении).

A long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long, during which you sleep or perform light activity: reading, talking, eating, or standing watch for no more than 2 hours of the rest period. If the rest is interrupted by a strenuous activity—such as attacking, taking damage, or casting a spell—you must start the rest over to gain any benefit from it, unless the interruption takes less than an hour.

You must have at least 1 hit point to take a long rest. At the end of the rest, you regain all your hit points and half of your maximum number of Hit Dice (round up].

You cannot benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period.

## Short Rest

A short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, during which you catch your breath, eat, drink, and clean and bind wounds.

You can spend one or more of your Hit Dice during a short rest, up to your maximum number of Hit Dice. For each Hit Die you spend in this way, roll the die and add your Constitution modifier to it. You regain hit points equal to the total. You can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll. Once you have spent all your Hit Dice, you must complete a long rest to regain them.


## Восстановление хит-поинтов

### Медленное природное лечение - Slow Natural Healing
Characters don't regain hit points at the end of a long rest. Instead, a character can spend Hit Dice to heal at the end of a long rest, just as with a short rest.

### Healer's Kit Dependency
A character can't spend any Hit Dice after finishing a short rest until someone expends one use of a healer's kit to bandage and treat the character's wounds.

# Litercay and languages

**Literacy:** Among the human populace literacy is not a given. In fact, for the majority of the populace “knowing your letters” is a rarity. It is not uncommon for someone to be able to speak many languages and simply be unable to read or write in any of them. As such literacy has become a soft social meter which displays either tutoring or noble blood.

There are four ways to gain literacy; race, background ,giving up a known language, or aquiring the linguist feat.

Both dwarves and elorii have strong traditions of education and gain literacy through their racial heritage. Some backgrounds grant literacy and if you choose a background which oes not grant literacy you may become literate by giving up one of your known languages.

# Modified Three Pillar

This version of three pillar experience rewards players for exploration and social interaction, while maintaining the traditional character advancement scale and allowing the GM to reward XP for encounters.

Instead of rewarding a fixed amount, for Exploration and Social Interaction players receive a percentage of the XP required for them to get from their current level to the next \(calculated from the base XP of their level to the next, not including XP they've earned in between.\)

They may receive a higher or lower percentage depending on the their tier of play compared to the magnitude of their accomplishment.

Main goals for receiving experience points: exploring, get friends and allies and survive in combats.


## Gaining Levels

Players gain levels according to the normal PHB Character Advancement table.

| XP      | Level | XP to Next Level |
|---------|-------|------------------|
| 0       | 1     | 300              |
| 300     | 2     | 600              |
| 900     | 3     | 1,800            |
| 2,700   | 4     | 3,800            |
| 6,500   | 5     | 7,500            |
| 14,000  | 6     | 9,000            |
| 23,000  | 7     | 11,000           |
| 34,000  | 8     | 14,000           |
| 48,000  | 9     | 16,000           |
| 64,000  | 10    | 21,000           |
| 85,000  | 11    | 15,000           |
| 100,000 | 12    | 20,000           |
| 120,000 | 13    | 20,000           |
| 140,000 | 14    | 25,000           |
| 165,000 | 15    | 30,000           |
| 195,000 | 16    | 30,000           |
| 225,000 | 17    | 40,000           |
| 265,000 | 18    | 40,000           |
| 302,000 | 19    | 50,000           |
| 355,000 | 20    | See Epic Boons   |

## Dividing XP

For Exploration and Social Interaction, the XP award for an adventure is the same for each member of the party, instead of being divided among them.

     However, this does not mean the XP is awarded for individual merit. XP is awarded when the party as a whole accomplishes something, without splitting hairs about who contributed to what the most.   

## Experience for Exploring Interactions

### Pillar 1: Exploration

For discovering both Items and Locations, each player gains 5% at their tier, 5% additional for every tier above, none for below their tier.   

#### Items

In this version, players are rewarded for discovering magic items that are of the highest nonconsumable rarity suggested for their tier as per Xanathar's Guide.

| Tier | Requirements to rarity or cost                                                |
|------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | A single art object or gem worth 100 gp or more, or a major uncommon item     |
| 2    | A single art object or gem worth 1,000 gp or more, or a major rare item       |
| 3    | A single art object or gem worth 5,000 gp or more, or a major very rare item  |
| 4    | A single art object or gem worth 50,000 gp or more, or a major legendary item |

#### Locations

A location's tier depends on the importance to your campaign, measured by the scope of its discovery or liberation's impact:
| Tier | Location importance                             |
|------|-------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | A location important to a small town or village |
| 2    | A location vital to a kingdom                   |
| 3    | A location important across the region          |
| 4    | A location of continent importance              |
| 5    | A location of planet importance                 |

## Experience for Social Interactions

### Pillar 2: Social Interaction

#### NPCs

Players gain XP for turning important NPCs into allies, aligning them with their cause or denying them as assets to their enemies. The XP they gain is based on the NPC's power and influence.

      Each player gains 5% at their tier, 5% additional for every tier above, 2% for below their tier.

| Tier | NPC influence                                                                              |
|------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | An NPC with influence over a small town or village, or the equivalent                      |
| 2    | An NPC with influence over a city or the equivalent                                        |
| 3    | An NPC with influence over a kingdom, continent, or the equivalent                         |
| 4    | An NPC \(including a deity\) with cosmic significance or influence across multiple worlds. |
| 5    | An NPC \(including a deity\) with cosmic significance or influence across multiple worlds. |

#### Role Play

This modified Three Pillar method also rewards players for inter-party role play. The difficulty of inter-party role play should remain fairly constant throughout all tiers of play, so unlike the other categories in this method it is not awarded based on tier. Instead, it is awarded for specific group activities.

When the party interacts in character during a session, each member gains 5%. If the interaction is only partially in character, they gain 2%. If they create a story-changing or divergent moment, they gain an extra 5%.

Here are some examples of these interactions \(obviously party interaction situations are not limited to these\):

The party argues in character.

The party comes to a decision in character.

The party solves a mystery or puzzle in character.

Some party members conspire to play a trick on another party member

Some party members confront other party members about a problem or secret.

The party convinces an NPC to give them information that the NPC previously did not want to give, a significantly lower price on an item, or another form of important help.

More than half the party gains inspiration or role plays their TBIFs.

The party agrees to take a quest from an NPC in need.   

## Experience for Combat Interactions

### Pillar 3: Combat

Players gain 85% of the encounter XP, rounding decimals down, divided between them and any NPCs that contributed. This is used for combats, traps, and puzzles which award XP.

TBD

# Pregenerated characters

# Rumors and bonds - class and background specific

# Factions

Disfavor with a faction imposes disadvantage on all Charisma (Persuasion) and Charisma (Intimidate) skill checks made with that faction. In the case of Favors with large groups, you only gain this penalty when interacting with those of high station such as a general, a king, or the patriarch of a patrician family associated with that power.

* You may use a Favor to cancel a Disfavor from the same faction. This voids both the Favor and Disfavor immediately.

* You may spend a Favor with a given faction/group/individual (at GM’s discussion) to gain the benefits of a one-time expenditure of 3 fame with that faction/group/individual. You may spend two favors with the same factionBto gain the benefits of a 5-point fame expenditure.

Важный момент. Члены фракция делятся на регуляров и нерегуляров. Регулярные члены фракции работают за деньги на фракцию и получают урезанные бенефиты. Нерегуляры обладают большей свободой, и в зависимости от ситуации могут даже отказаться от задания.

Конкретная реализация зависит в каждом случае от конкретной игры, мастера, игрока и задания.
Пример. Белдора Арфист в СКТ - регуляр.

Персонажи в Лунном море и приключениях сезонных Лиги - регуляры.

Персонаж арфист в ОоотА, СКТ, Принцах Апокалипсиса - не регуляр.

## Intelligent Creatures

Intelligent creatures are creatures that have a value of Intelligence of 6 or more. If such a creature is used as a mount, it acts independetly and can also attack as one of it's actions, as stated in the official rules. Intelligent creatures are independent creatures. Indeed there can be communication between the creature and it's master, however the creatures acts independently and thus have a turn of their own. This applies to also to riden mounts. These creatures are controlled by the DM.

NOTE: The only exception for this rule is the mount from the **Find Steed** spell. Due to the nature of the spell, that mount is controlled by the PC. Whether intelligent or not, each creature is still a beast at heart. It might disagree with the rider going in a certain direction such as jumping great heights. The DM might ask the PC to make a particular check whether to remain mounted or maybe the creature just runs off.

Intelligent creatures might challenge their master more then non-intelligent creatures, especially when the mount is being asked to do something that might hard for it, it considers dangerous or maybe something that it fears.

## Death of a Mount or Companion

Mounts roll for death saves. A dead mount can be resurrected if the requirements for a ressuraction spell are met. This applies also the companion creatures. Potions Potions and other consumables work as intended even on mounts. But so do the harmful effects of negative potions and poisons.

## Companion Needs

Just like a normal PC, mounts and pets have basic needs. They need: Food and Water to survive Rest after a long day To breathe Someone to take care of them Food and Water is either brought along before the adventure started or else it can be scavanged while in session. Most of the time it will be easy for the mount to be sustained while on an adventure, however some enviroments \(such as deserts or frozen landscapes\) will make it very hard and might possibly starve your mount. Normal exhaustion rules apply if a mount is not sustained.

Food and Water Needs

| Creature Size | Food per Day | Water per Day |
|---------------|--------------|---------------|
| Tiny          | 1/4 pound    | 1/4 gallon    |
| Small         | 1 pound      | 1 gallon      |
| Medium        | 1 pound      | 1 gallon      |
| Large         | 4 pounds     | 4 gallons     |
| Huge          | 16 pounds    | 16 gallons    |
| Gargantuan    | 64 pounds    | 64 gallons    |

## Official Ruling from the D&D Player's Handbook 5e

```text
Resting after a long day is a big must if you want your mount to remain healthy. They will suffer normal exhaustion effects if they fail to rest or are being pushed over the limit. Breathing is a rather obvious need. Depending on the nature of the mount, different mounts can breathe in different enviroments and cannot in others. Sometime a PCs has to leave his mount behind if the mount cannot breathe in a certain enviroment he wants to explore. This takes us to the following need. Someone to take care of the mount is needed, especially if the mount is not Intelligent. As discussed before, most of the time the PC has to provide nurishment for his mount. If in danger, the PC needs to protect his mount. Most mounts cannot really fend of for themselves but are a very valuable asset when guided by someone. All of the above applies also for companion creatures. In town, adventurer owned mounts and beasts can be left at the stables were all their needs will be looked after. Stables are discussed in the next chapter.

## Riding a mount with no saddle

No saddle while mounting means that both the beast and the rider and uncomforable. The rider does not have anything that supports him on his mount. Any check done by the PC to remain mounted is done at a disadvantage. Any attack preformed by the PC will be at a disadvantage. While in combat, the rider has to perform a check to remain mounted if the mount moves and the rider does any other action other then try keep steady

## Combat Mechanics

In this section we are going to discuss the combat mechanics of a mounted PC and his mount.

### Mount Actions in Combat

A non-intelligent mount can take three different types of actions in combat, while an intelligent one can also take any other actions from its statblock.

#### Dash

A mount can take this action to move twice his normal movement speed.

#### Disengage

When disengaging a mount can move without triggering attacks of opportunity. \(Homebrew\) The rider will still provoke an attack of opportunity.\*

#### Dodge

The mount can take the dodge action as normal PC or NPCs can. However, only creatures attacking the mount itself will get disadvantage on attack rolls and only the mount will get advantage on Dexterity saving throws. The rider is not affected.

### Area of Effect on Mounted Creatures

When a mounted PC and his mount are inside the Area of Effect of a spell or effect, the rider can be affected too. If HALF the squares that make up the mount's token are inside the are of effect, and that effect affects in a 3D spectrum \(not only the ground\), then both rider and mount are effected.

### Ranged Attacks while Mounted

Riders doing ranged attacks while mounted will have disadvantage on the attack roll. This also applies to both ranged weapon attacks and ranged spell attacks.

### Animal Handling

Animal handling is a vital skill when it comes to mounts. A rider needs to be good with animals if it wants to ride one. If a character does not have proficiency in Animal Handling, all rolls related to keeping control of the mount and related will be at a flat DISADVANTAGE, no matter all the other roll modifiers. You still get the +/- modifier related to Animal Handling.

Note: A mount summoned by Find STEED does not require proficiency in animal handling since the nature of the spell.

### Keeping Control of the Mount

At the start of every turn, a mounted creature has to succeed a DC 10 Animal Handling check. This check is straight forward. If the character has proficiency in Animal Handling then he rolls with advantage. If the character does not have Animal Handling, he rolls with disadvantage. If he fails the Animal Handling check then he must succeed DC 10 Dexterity saving throw \(modifiers from saddle's apply\) otherwise he will be knocked prone 5ft away from the mount and take 1d6 bludgeoning damage. The mount will dash as far as possible away from it's rider. That will be the end of the rider's turn. If the rider succeeds the Dexterity saving throw, he will land on his feet 5ft next to the mount. He will still have his turn, but the mount will still be spooked off.

## Melee Reach

Mounted combat adds a 3 Dimenstional element to combat. Every creature has his own height. If you ride on top of a creature, you are standing on that creauture's back, hench elevated from the ground by that creature's height. Each mount has a height value stated in it's character sheet. That value is the distance the rider is standing above the ground when riding the said mount.

Mounted character melee weapon without "REACH" attribute:

Mount Size Cannot hit

Medium - None

Large - Tiny or smaller

Huge - Medium or smaller

Gargantum - Large or smaller

Mounted character melee weapon with "REACH" attribute:

Mount Size Cannot hit

Medium - None

Large - None

Huge - Medium or smaller

Gargantum - Large or smaller

**Note:** These melee range restrictions also apply when a creature of the stated size wants to attack the rider who is standing on a mount.

For example a medium or smaller sized creature, wielding a melee weapon without the 'Reach' attribute, cannot hit the rider of a Huge or bigger mount.

## Extra Attack

You gain the Extra Attack class feature when you meet one of the following conditions:
•	You have five levels in the fighter class
•	You have eight combined levels in any classes that have the Extra Attack feature
Once you have Extra Attack, you don’t gain an additional Extra Attack unless you have eleven levels in the fighter class.

# How to Play

## Contests

A contest pits two or more characters or creatures against each other, with the outcome determined by each contender’s luck and talent. Contests are a form of ability check, except that instead of matching your roll against a DC, both you and the creature you are opposing make a roll. You then compare the two results to see who succeeds.

When to Have a Contest. Contests arise when two creatures attempt to do the same thing and only one can succeed, such as if both you and a bandit attempt to snatch up a magic ring that has fallen on the floor. In other cases, you might attempt something that another creature actively opposes. If you attempt to push open a door that an orc holds shut from the other side, you make an ability check to open the door, and the orc makes a check to keep it shut.

Resolving a Contest. A contest uses the same rules as an ability check, except that more than one creature makes a check. Any bonuses and penalties you apply when making an ability check that is not a contest also apply to contests involving that ability.
The creature with the higher check result wins the contest. The creature either succeeds at its action or prevents its opponent from succeeding.

If the contest ends in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant might win the contest by default. If you and a bandit tie in a contest to snatch a ring, neither one of you grabs it. If you tie in a contest to push open a door held shut by an orc, the door remains shut.

Likewise, if you tie in a contest to hide from another creature, your situation with respect to that creature does not change. If the creature was already aware of you before the contest, you fail to hide. If it was not aware of you before the contest, you remain hidden.

# DM Guidelines

## Resolving Tasks

In the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS® game, a Dungeon Master must take a number of roles, all at the same time. A DM serves as a referee, interpreting the rules and resolving any conflicts that arise because of them. The DM builds the world, creates adventures, and places monsters and treasure. The DM is the characters’ eyes and ears, describing what the characters can see and hear to the players.

The first rule of being a good DM is to remember that the rules are a tool that you and the players use to have a good time. The rules aren’t in charge. You, the DM, are the one in charge of the game. Guide the play experience and the use of the rules so that as many of your players have a good time as possible. There will be setbacks, such as a character being slain by an unlucky die roll, but look for ways to turn setbacks into interesting complications in the game’s story.

The second rule is to remember that the DM’s power comes with responsibility. Be fair and impartial with the players. Don’t force your story upon them or give them a game where their choices don’t matter. By the same token, challenge their characters with deadly monsters, fiendish traps, and vexing puzzles. A good DM is no pushover, but a good DM is also never simply out to slaughter the characters.

## When to Use Dice

Characters in the D&D game frequently attempt a tremendous variety of tasks, from running across a swinging rope bridge to talking their way out of a sticky spot with an orc chieftain. All these tasks are resolved in an interaction between you (the DM] and the player whose character is attempting the task.

When a player wants to take an action, it’s often appropriate to just let the action succeed. A character doesn’t normally need to make a Dexterity check to walk across an empty room, or a Charisma check to order a mug of ale in a tavern. Only call for a roll if you think it’s worth taking the time for the rules to come into the flow of the game. Ask yourself two questions to aid your decision.
Is the action being taken so easy, so free of stress or conflict, or so appropriate to the situation that there should be no chance of failure? “So easy” should take into account the ability score associated with the intended action. It’s easy for someone with a Strength score of 18 to flip over a table, though not easy for someone with a Strength score of 9.

Is the action being taken so inappropriate or impossible that it would never work? Hitting the moon with an arrow is, for instance, impossible in almost any circumstance.

If the answer to both of these questions is no, some kind of roll is appropriate.

# Exploration

## Hazards

Is there a chance that failing a task might lead to a disastrous outcome for the character? You decide whether a hazard applies to a particular ability check and when the hazard applies.

A hazard might affect a character who fails an ability check. For example, a character who attempts and fails a Strength (Athletics] check to jump across a pit that he or she couldn’t normally clear probably falls into the pit. Sometimes, though, a hazard kicks in only if the character misses the ability check’s DC (or loses a contest] by a significant margin, such as 5 or 10. Examples of hazards can be found in the “Tasks and Skills” section.

### Requirements

A task might require a specific tool or circumstance for a character to have any chance of success. For example, you might need a magnifying glass to accurately appraise a gem.

A character who cannot meet the requirements for a task automatically fails. One who meets them can attempt an ability check as normal for the task.

You can decide to waive this requirement, but the task should be hard to complete without it. You might give the character disadvantage on the ability check, or set the DC higher than you would for a character who met the requirement.

Otherwise, requirements should come up only rarely. Use them to encourage the players to come up with clever solutions, not to punish them for trying to do interesting things.

## Engaging the Players

As a DM, you could memorize these guidelines, apply them flawlessly, and still miss out on the point of D&D. Unlike some other games, D&D is a flexible set of guidelines, not a rigid set of laws.

When you ask a player to make an ability check, an attack, or a saving throw, you first should focus on engaging the players’ imaginations. Describe the scene to them, and pull in details such as sights, sounds, and even smells to make the action vivid.
More important, you want the players to become fully engaged in the game. Reward inventive players who look beyond game options to describe their characters’ actions. Roleplaying games stand out from other types of games because they allow for this type of creativity. Encourage it whenever you can.

The easiest way to do so is to make imaginative solutions the easiest path to success for the adventurers. Consider the following options.

**Ability Checks.** When a player makes an ability check, invite him or her to describe the character’s action. If the player makes clever use of the situation in the description, consider either granting an automatic success or advantage on the ability check.
Contests. In a contest, an ingenious description that points to a key advantage that a character might gain could lead you to grant the character advantage on the check.

**Attacks and Saving Throws.** A colorful description is nice for attacks and saving throws, but should rarely be the avenue to gaining a concrete game benefit, since it is too easy to abuse such an approach. You might have players endlessly describing how they resist a mind flayer’s mind blast or trying to narrate every detail of a sword blow. In most cases, spells and special abilities serve to grant characters advantage on their attacks and saving throws.

That said, if the situation warrants it, use advantage to grant a character an edge.

**Disadvantage.** Not every idea is a good one. A character might try to win the prince’s favor by bragging about all the bandits he or she slew, not realizing that the prince is an avowed pacifist. If an idea backfires on a player, apply disadvantage to the ability check or attack.## Multiple Ability Checks

Sometimes a character fails an ability check and wants to try again. You have a couple of options in this case.

In most cases, the character can simply try again. The only real cost is the time it takes. The character keeps trying and, after enough time passes, eventually succeeds. To speed things up, you can assume that a character can automatically succeed at a task if he or she spends twenty times the normal amount of time needed to complete it. This exception does not allow a character to turn an impossible task into a successful one.

In other cases, the first failure renders subsequent ability checks impossible. For instance, a rogue tries to trick a town guard into thinking that the group members are undercover agents of the king. The rogue loses the contest of Charisma (Deception] against Wisdom. The same lie told again clearly won’t work.

### Dungeon Adventuring


It should come as no surprise that dungeons, subterranean complexes of maze-like passages and chambers, play a key role in DUNGEONS & DRAGONS. Most adventures feature at least one dungeon, and it's possible to set a campaign entirely within an enormous, sprawling dungeon that can take characters from 1st to 20th level.

This section provides a turn-based system for exploring a dungeon. The rules address how to move through and investigate a dungeon, the tasks that characters can undertake while they explore, and how those tasks are performed.

Your Dungeon Map
Before the characters can explore your dungeon, you need to have a map that outlines its key geographic features and terrain.
A dungeon can range in size from a few chambers beneath a ruined temple to a huge complex of rooms and passages that extends hundreds of feet below the earth. It's best to use graph paper to map your dungeon, with each square on the paper representing an area of 10 feet by 10 feet.
You track the characters' movement on your map to determine what sort of obstacles and monsters they encounter. Your adventure notes should indicate the contents of key chambers and passages in the dungeon.
Light. Darkness might be the default condition inside an underground complex, but your dungeon can still have plenty of light sources. Most inhabited areas might be illuminated to some extent; even creatures that can see in the dark still use fire for warmth, cooking, and defense.
 
At the other end of the spectrum, many subterranean creatures, including undead, have no need for light, either because they have darkvision or because they don't rely on sight. In regions where these creatures operate, the characters must bring their own light sources.
Dungeon Features
At its most basic, a dungeon is composed of spaces that are enclosed by walls and separated from one another by doors and other barriers. It has other features, such as traps and portcullises, that further set it apart from aboveground adventuring environments.
Walls. The walls in a dungeon can be thick, natural stone formations or manufactured structures (usually wooden] built to subdivide large chambers.
Walls have hit points and can be destroyed. A creature can break through a 5-foot-square section of wall by succeeding on a Strength check with a DC equal to the wall's current hit points. The hit points and break DC for a section of wall are determined by its material and thickness.
Hit Points/Inch of Thickness
60
5
30
30
10
Doors. Intelligent dungeon inhabitants will barricade or lock doors when possible, especially if they expect attackers. The DC to break down a door depends on the materials used to create it. In addition, characters can attack doors in an attempt to batter them down. The Strength DC to break down a door equals its current hit points.
Door Material Hit Points
Adamantine	120
Glass	5
Iron	60
Stone	60
Wood	10
Portcullis. A portcullis is a set of vertical bars reinforced with one or two horizontal bands of iron. A portcullis is dropped to block a passage, 
with a winch and chain used to raise it back up. The big benefit provided by a portcullis is that it blocks a passage while still allowing guards to watch the area beyond and fire arrows or cast spells into it.
A portcullis can be lifted as an action that requires a DC 20 Strength check, or no check if a character can use that action to turn its winch. A creature that makes a DC 25 Strength check can bend the portcullis’s bars apart to allow creatures to pass through it.
Secret Doors. Some doors in a dungeon are crafted to blend into the walls that surround them. An Intelligence (Search] check is required to find clues pointing to the presence of a secret door. The DC is 10, 20, or 30, with higher DCs denoting better craftsmanship. A secret door that has been detected is treated like a normal door of the appropriate material (usually stone].
Traps. Intelligent dungeon dwellers set traps in areas where they expect enemies to approach, while long-forgotten tombs might have traps set hundreds of years ago.
The Dungeon Turn
This is the sequence of play for a minute of travel and exploration in a dungeon.
1.	Travel Pace and Exploration Tasks. The players decide what direction their characters will move in and their travel pace. They also decide on their exploration tasks, chosen from the list under “Exploration Tasks.” The players should also determine their formation (often called “marching order”]: who is in the front, the middle, and the back of the group.
2.	Progress on the Map. Follow the characters’ path on your dungeon map, describing what they see and allowing them to make decisions as they move. The characters might encounter creatures that you have placed in certain locations. If they do so, an interaction or combat encounter ensues.
3.	Random Encounters. Check for random encounters once every 10 minutes. If monsters are encountered, resolve any interaction or combat that occurs between the creatures and the characters.
After performing these steps, go back to the first step and repeat the sequence for another turn.

Замки и твердыни Фаэруна - обычно укрепленные здания с огромной физической защитой. Магическая защита также может присутствовать, если замок был в свое время занят способными заклинателями.
 
Разрушенные цитадели обычно занимают стратегическое положение. Как и крепости, они содержали гарнизоны отрядов и арсеналы, заполненные оружием, и иногда служили для сохранения магических артефактов и религиозных реликвий. Некоторые замки также получили известность или славу из-за размещения военных, религиозных и монашеских орденов.

## Башни
 
Разрушенные магические башни рассеяны по всей длине и ширине Фаэруна. Некоторые далеки от цивилизованных областей, другие стоят посреди городов и городков. Будь это шпиль волшебника, магический университет или палата призывания, скрытая глубоко под землей - такая башня, как правило, принадлежала магу великой силы, который использовал ее как дом, библиотеку и лабораторию. Ныне покинутые, эти башни соблазняют любопытных слухами о забытых магических методах, таинственных заклинаниях и изделиях великой силы.
 
Магические башни обеспечивают богатство приключенческих возможностей для тех, кто ищет магической силы и знаний, но опытные авантюристы предпочитают знать, а не предполагать, что владелец покинутой башни мертв. Чрезвычайно мощные волшебники и колдуны, путешествующие на другие планы или даже в другие миры, могут проводить столетия далеко от Торила, но все же башни редко остаются незащищенными. Некоторые такие структуры имеют сигналы тревоги, уведомляющие их владельцев в случае вторжения, а некоторые могут призывать своих владельцев из других измерений, если возникнет такая потребность.
 
Кроме того, некоторые башни, которые кажутся пустынными, не покинуты действительно — их древние владельцы остаются внутри как личи, демиличи или спектральные маги.

# Rumors

In addition to the constant threat posed by the numerous monsters of the Savage Frontier, more insidious perils are manifesting. The Zhentarim seek to extend their influence westward from Llorkh. The Kraken Society, an organization of spies, assassins, and sinister dealers in lore and knowledge, is well ensconced in Luskan and other coastal cities and dreams of subverting inland towns such as Yartar along the Dessarin valley. And the Arcane Brotherhood of Luskan contests the influence of Waterdeep's Lords over the region.
Adventurers come to the Silver Marches to advance the cause of civilization by scouring the land for monster lairs, cleansing dangerous ruins, and driving orc raiders back to their mountain dens. Silverymoon's growth and prosperity have brought new enemies though - the merchants and proud lords of cities such as Luskan and Yartar who grow jealous of the riches that flow through the Silver Marches.

Barbaric Justice: An Uthgardt barbarian of the Black Lion tribe flees into the arms of an adventuring company on the road, pursued by a small party of warriors determined to hunt him down. The fugitive, a young hunter named Thurvald, claims that he is accused of a crime he did not commit, the murder of the shaman Bogohardt at Beorunna's WelL The pursuers, of course, say he's guilty.

If the heroes choose to protect Thurvald, the hunters are out matched by the party and can be driven off with a hard fight. They return in greater force later and trail Thuvald and the heroes wherever they go, even into the city of Silverymoon.

The heroes can simply turn over Thurvald to his pursuers ... but he really is innocent. Thurvald is a shapechanger (a snow leopard), a secret suspected by his tribe and known to the People of the Black Blood. Malar's cultists tried and failed to recruit Thurvald of his own free will, so they murdered the tribal shaman and framed Thurvald. They plan to let the Black Lion tribe inflict its harsh justice on Thurvald and then rescue him before he is killed.

Thurvald knows he was framed and knows the two Malar worshipers are responsible. To prove Thurvald's innocence, the heroes must track down the real murderers and expose their guilt.

Giant Opportunities: Taern Horn blade, the new High Mage of Silverymoon, perceives the arrival of the giants in the Evermoors as a chance to pacify the Silver Marches' western border. Silverymoon seeks agents to enter the Moors, identify and contact the most lawful and powerful giants of the area, and attempt to form an alliance to reduce the giants' threat to Silverymoon and Nesme to the west.

Dark Deeds in Ascore: The ruined dwarven city of Ascore on the border of Anauroch was once the gateway to the realm of Deizoun, a rich seaport on the long-vanished Narrow Sea. An expedition from the City of Shade has set up a temporary camp in the ruins, driving off any adventurers who come to explore the old dwarven city. A survivor from one of these adventuring companies reports that a mighty archmage leads the shade effort, which seems to be centered around a strange pool of liquid shadow surrounded by thirteen odd, pyramid-like structures. What are the shades up to? What might they unleash in their efforts to achieve their objective?

Missing Emissary: Two tendays ago, a wizard escorted by four Everlund rangers went into the High Forest to speak with Turlang about the trees' advance upon Everlund's walls. All contact with the wizard has been lost, though divination spells indicate that the wizard, at least, is still alive. Did the wizard pay the price for delivering bad news to Turlang, or did she fall prey to one of the forest's other perils?

Tribes of the Silver Marches

Black Lion: The Black Lions fear their ancestor mound (Beorunna's Well) as much as they revere it, and perhaps moreso. They do not post guards at Beorunna's Well itself, but rather leave that task to the Red Tiger tribe.

Black Raven: The Black Raven tribe appoints an honor guard of no less than ten warriors (CN human Bbn2) and the same number of giant ravens to remain at Raven Rock at all times. The guardians watch over not only the tribe's ancestor mound, but its sacrificial treasure shrine as well.

Gray Wolf: The Gray Wolf tribe no longer participates in helping the Black Ravens guard Raven Rock.

Red Tiger: Protecting the ancestor mound at Beorunna's Well is a task appointed for the Red Tiger's young members who are about to take their tribal vows. At any given time, three to six young men and women (CG human War1) are guided by a tribal cleric (CN human Clr4 of Uthgar).

Sky Pony: The Sky Pony tribe considers it an honor and a sacred duty to provide a constant guard for its ancestor mound. It considers the watch more ceremonial than practical, however. A trio of tribal warriors (CN human Bbn1) is always on guard at One Stone.

Ghaurin's Hold что под Wildlands Rest содержит бессметные сокровища

"Tell Us Who to Hate": The centaurs of the High Forest have received multiple divinations telling them that they must win a war in the next month or lose their tribe's luck. The divinations specified that the centaurs cannot declare the war themselves -- they have to be told who to war against by a non-centaur who happens to be a member of a PC race. After the PC obliges, the centaurs reveal the second part of the prophecy: The noncentaur who names their enemy must lead them into battle. If the PCs avoid doing their prophetic duty, make sure that the non-centaur NPC who names an enemy picks a group the PCs are friendly with.

The Latest from Silverymoon: Alustriel of the Seven Sisters, the ruler of Silverymoon for 134 years until she stepped down to oversee all the Silver March, encourages stronger bonds between the diverse races of Silverymoon. Marriage and children between the races are still relatively rare, but child-rearing, education, and professional training are often so intermingled that outsiders think of Silverymoon as the place where elves think they're dwarves, dwarves think they're elves, and humans think they're everything.

Tag in the Woods: Giants from the Evermoors chase a small army of orcs out of the moors into the Moonwood. While the orcs play the mice to the giants' dire cats, the giants begin to realize that they like it here. Not many folks around. Lots of big trees. Warmer than the moor. Nice place to live. The giants may hate orcs, but that doesn't make them nice giants, so the PCs need to dissuade them before they get too comfortable in their "new home."

Many ruins in Old Delzoun contained lost portals to the Underdark. Underdark denizens sometimes used these portals during surface raids.

In Silverymoon it is joked that Quaervarr is valuable in the alliance just to preserve its fine inn, the Whistling Stag.

Tavern tales told of a small coffer of coins once found behind a loose stone in the cellar wall. As a result of this persistent rumor, every part of the cellar was excavated multiple times by treasure seekers, but nothing was ever found. The Harpers rebuilt the cellar after each act of vandalism, which gave rise to another rumor about the cellar being haunted or magical.
Northwind Keep

The local barbarians avoided the subterranean tunnels because of tales of "strange froglike humanoids (possibly slaad) dancing around bonfires in the ruins." Dungeon of the Ruins

## Common Themes & Conflicts
The Orcs vs. Everybody
 
The orcs in the North wage a constant war of raid and retreat on frontier out¬posts. Small wandering bands constantly harry farms and villages, stealing live¬stock and brutally killing people. Just as often, they take slaves. Attempts to nego¬tiate or control them for any length of time end in failure. Bounties placed on orcish heads only seem to encourage the beasts to attack for sport.
 
The Luskan/Ruathym War
 
The status of this conflict depends on when the DM begins the campaign. Dur¬ing the Year of the Prince, these two are waging bloodthirsty war upon on one another, with Ruathym getting the worst of it. Shiploads of Luskan raiders plunder and pillage the Ruathym coast and slay their leader.
 
During the Year of Shadows, Water- deep forces a truce and ends the conflict. In so doing, an alliance, the Captains' Con-federation, is forged between the Luskanites and the island kingdoms.
 
Con¬federation warriors raid cities along the Sword Coast in huge numbers and no ship at sea is safe from Northmen pirates. The Year of Shadows ends with the Lords of Waterdeep in council, deciding wheth¬er to declare war or not.
 
The Uthgardt Barbarians vs. Civi¬lization
 
The average Uthgardt regards civiliza¬tion as a cancer to be cut out. Most tribes regularly raid civilized settle¬ments, slaying domesticated animals, burning buildings, and crushing crops. Captives become slaves, though young¬sters are often adopted into the tribe if they seem sturdy enough.
 
The Uthgardt vs. the Orcs
 
This is a holy war. Its roots date back to the formation of the Uthgardt as a peo¬ple. The barbarians and the orcs com¬pete directly with one another for the same resources. Savage humans and bloodthirsty orcs fight to the death upon meeting. Adventurers in the North could do worse than to aid the Uthgardt in such a conflict.
 
Monsters vs. Humans
 
The monsters of the North, including the trolls of the Evermoors, treat humans — civilized and barbarian alike —as fruit ripe for the picking. There are always giants who raid villag¬es, foul creatures who wake hungry and leave their lairs to feast on a village, dragons who crave treasure, vampires with unholy thirsts, and more.
 
 
Pirates vs. Merchants
 
Piracy is an accepted fact of life in the northern Trackless Sea. Pirates attack ships along the Sword Coast from Ches (March) until Uktar (November). Most are Northmen, but about a third hail from southern lands.
 
Hellgate Keep vs. Mankind
The demonic forces of Hellgate Keep continually press against the human and dwarven folk in the northeast. Men have not been able to drive the demons out, but mercenary companies and adventuring bands can always find employ as guardians in Turnstone Pass. A monastery of Helm, near Neverwin- ter, sponsors a company of 100 troops of all character classes each year. This group, called Helm's Hundred, leaves Helm's Hold each spring for Sundabar.

# Измерение времени - About time measurement

Gary Gygax said “YOU CANNOT HAVE A MEANINGFUL CAMPAIGN IF STRICT TIME RECORDS ARE NOT KEPT.“
 
I almost didn’t post this for fear of it being misused. Please don’t simply look up the parties travel pace below, determine what was found, mark off the time and move on. This is a role playing game after all. The following is intended as an aid in Dungeon Mastering a game, not as a substitute for it.
 
Time in a dungeon is measured in minutes – switching to 6 second rounds when there is an encounter.
 
The following is my interpretation of the official rules and a few of my house rules mixed in, presented here as advice to Dungeon Masters. Where I refer to “you”, I mean the DM. This is specifically for a dungeon crawls, but most of it applies to all similar situations. This is intended as a guide for tracking time passage in a dungeon and also for a guide in deciding when to use a character’s passive perception score or to roll a perception check.
 
The Dungeon Master describes what the PCs can see, hear, etc. Most of the time you can expect that the PCs are being observant so if they could notice something, they will notice it. So don’t wait for a player to say his character is examining the floor, or looking for footprints to tell them that there’s an obvious set of footprints on the floor in front of him. Players can ask questions or tell you what their PCs are going to do (or attempt to do). Players should never have to refer to skill names to do this. You decide if they need to roll an ability or skill check and which one. To keep the game moving at a reasonable pace, I recommend that you keep the die rolling to a minimum. If a player’s character would most likely notice something or recognize something or understand something based on his abilities and background, no roll is required. Just tell him.
 
The DM will roll all of the PCs search checks in secret and tell the players what, if anything, their characters found. That way, if they don’t find anything, they won’t know if there wasn’t anything there or if there was something and they didn’t find it. Another advantage of rolling behind your DM screen is that you can ignore the roll when necessary. If you want them to find something (or not find it), ignore the roll and tell them what they found (or that they didn’t find anything).
 
***Ask them for their marching order, but don’t ask if they are moving at a “fast pace”, “normal pace” or “slow pace”. That makes it sound too much like a computer game. Instead, simply ask them what they are doing. Use their answer to determine their pace and use that to help you determine how long it will take and what they do or do not notice.***
 
In addition to the fast pace, normal pace and slow pace listed in the Player’s Handbook, I have added a “very fast” pace and an ”extremely slow” pace.
 
Overview:
 
1. Moving at a very fast pace they automatically fail all perception checks. If they say “We are getting out of here as fast as we can” they are obviously not going to take the time to check for traps or secret doors so they are moving at a very fast pace (600 feet per minute).
 
2. Moving at a fast pace uses their passive perception scores with a -5 penalty. If they say “We are going to move through here as quickly as we can and still be on the lookout for traps”, you can say to yourself that that sounds like a fast pace (400 feet per minute).
 
3. Moving at a normal pace uses their passive perception scores. If they don’t give you any indication of how fast or cautiously they are moving through corridors, assume that they are moving at this pace. If they say “We are going to be watching for hidden monsters and checking for traps and secret doors as we proceed cautiously down the corridor”, you know that, even though this sounds like it might be a slow pace it is actually the normal way adventurers would explore a dungeon so it is a normal pace (300 feet per minute).
 
4. Moving at a slow pace they can be stealthy or search for things. If they don’t give you any indication of how fast they are searching a room, assume that they are moving at this pace. They make a Dexterity (Stealth) check if they are hiding or being stealthy. Make a Wisdom (Perception) check for them if they are searching for secret doors or traps. If not actively searching, they use their passive perception scores. If they say “We are trying not to be noticed as we proceed cautiously down the corridor” they are being stealthy and can only move at a slow pace (200 feet per minute).
 
5. Moving at an extremely slowly pace they will automatically find anything that can be found. If they say “We know there must be a secret door in this corridor, so we are going to search until we find it”, you know that they are going to keep looking until they find it if they can, so they are traveling at a extremely slow pace (30 feet per minute).
 
The times listed below are the suggested minimum times required. Additional time may be required depending on circumstances and PC actions. Anything found (secret doors, traps, treasures, and especially monsters) will add to the listed times below as they take the time to deal with what they have found.
 
* If they find a secret door they may then attempt to find a means to open it.
 
* I might have the searcher make an Intelligence (Investigation) check and subtract the results form 20 minutes for low long it takes. I will never let them find a secret door and never find out how to open it!
 
* If they find a trap they may then attempt to disarm or avoid it.
 
* It takes 5 minutes to disarm traps or pick a lock if proficient with thieves tools; 10 minutes otherwise. This assumes fairly straightforward mechanisms, not complex puzzles
 
* If they find a treasure they may then check it for traps.
 
 
Details:
 
Traversing corridors, stairs, and other passageways:
 
•When moving at a very fast pace (600 feet per minute), all attempts to notice any secret doors, hidden monsters or traps will fail. This speed is equivalent to the Dash action.
 
•When moving at a fast pace (400 feet per minute), passive Wisdom (Perception) scores, with a -5 penalty, will be used to see if they notice any secret doors, hidden monsters or traps.
 
•When moving at a normal pace (300 feet per minute), passive Wisdom (Perception) scores will be used to see if they notice any secret doors, hidden monsters or traps.
 
•When moving at a slow pace (200 feet per minute), the characters can attempt to hide or be stealthy. If hiding, Dexterity (Stealth) checks will be used against the Wisdom (Perception) checks of any monsters that are actively searching for them, and against the passive Wisdom (Perception) scores of any monsters that aren’t searching. Moving at this pace they can actively search for hidden doors or traps. Roll a Wisdom (Perception) check for the searchers and let them know if they found anything in this 200 foot length of corridor. Let the single roll be for detecting hidden doors and/or traps regardless of what they say they are searching for. Note that if they say they are being stealthy, but don’t express an interest in watching out for traps or finding secret doors, only roll Dexterity (Stealth) checks and use passive Wisdom (Perception) scores. Conversely, if they say that they are looking for traps, or secret doors but don’t seem interested in being stealthy, roll Wisdom (Perception) checks only.
 
•If the party intends to take as much time as required to thoroughly search a section of corridor, the party will be moving at an extremely slowly pace (30 feet per minute). This represents that the character is being extremely cautious and diligent in his searching. At this pace that character will automatically succeed at finding any secret doors, hidden monsters or traps that can be found by that character. [The DMG says “In some cases, a character is free to [retry a failed ability check]; the only real cost is the time it takes[…] To speed things up, assume that a character spending ten times the normal amount of time needed to complete a task automatically succeeds at that task.” This is the 5e equivalent to the 3.5e “Taking 20” rule.]
 
* One character can search the walls, floor and ceiling of a 5 foot wide passage, or one side of a wider passage out to 5 feet from the wall.
 
* 2 characters can cover a 10 foot wide passage.
 
* Characters that are searching can perform no other activities.
 
* Characters that are not searching can be on the lookout for monsters. For large parties they may need one lookout near the front and another one in the rear. If a monster approaches the group from a direction that is being watched, the Dexterity (Stealth) check of that character will be used against the Wisdom (Perception) checks of any monsters that are actively searching for them, and against the passive Wisdom (Perception) scores of any monsters that aren’t searching.
 
### Searching a Room:
 
If the party opens a door but doesn’t enter a room and only observes it from the doorway it doesn’t take any additional time to be able to map its location and general notes about it, but not its exact size or anything about the room that cannot be quickly seen. A detailed description will require that the party enters the room.
 
After they enter the room, describe what they see and ask what each character is doing. Describe the results of their activities. If they say “I am searching the room”. Don’t ask “What are you searching for?” rather say something like “What does searching the room look like? Describe exactly what your character is doing.” If they say “I am looking for secret doors.” Don’t ask which 5 foot section of wall he is searching, rather assume he will search all of the walls and use the travel paces descried below to determine his success or failure. If it makes a difference, or if you simply want him to think it might, you could ask where he is starting his search and which direction he will be searching from there. A room can be memorable and fun if you can get them to describe how they are interacting with the objects in the room.
 
The party may have a different travel pace for rooms than it does for corridors. Their pace may change in a room if they discover something interesting (or dangerous) but I wouldn’t normally mark off more than 10 minutes per room unless they slow to an extremely slow pace. Your players should be able to search as much as they want. Just warn them of the consequences (time passing, wandering monsters, etc.) ahead of time.
 
How pace of travel effects checking out rooms:
 
•Very fast pace (600 feet per minute – measured from entrance to exit by the shortest path). Treat these rooms like corridors. They are almost running through the rooms and won’t notice anything much more than their size and location. They automatically fail all perception checks. They will be surprised by any monsters waiting for them. They may surprise monsters that aren’t expecting them.
 
•Fast pace (1 minute per room). They are mostly just passing through. They can note what is in the room, its size, number and location of its exits. The Passive Wisdom (Perception) scores of the searchers, with a -5 penalty, will be used to see if they notice any secret doors, hidden monsters or traps. They are moving through the room too fast to search for any hidden treasure but will notice things that are in plain sight.
 
•Normal pace (5 minutes per room). Use this pace if they want to search the room but want to be quick about it. The passive Wisdom (Perception) scores of the searchers will be used to see if they notice any secret doors, hidden monsters or traps. At this pace they can make a quick search for hidden treasure at a disadvantage using their Wisdom (Perception) scores.
 
•Slow pace (10 minutes per room). Use this pace if they don’t give you any other indication of how fast they are searching a room. Use this pace if they want to loot the room, or if they want to be stealthy. Roll the Wisdom (Perception) checks of the searchers to see if they notice any secret doors, hidden monsters, hidden treasure or traps. If they are being stealthy, their Dexterity (Stealth) checks will be used against the Wisdom (Perception) checks of any monsters that are in the room or that enter the room and that are watching for them, and against the passive Wisdom (Perception) scores of any monsters that aren’t.
 
•Extremely slowly pace (1 hour per room). At this pace they can carefully examine every inch of the room. At this pace they will automatically succeed at finding any secret doors, hidden monsters, hidden treasure or traps that can be found by their characters. If there is something in the room that they wouldn’t be able to find even if they rolled a 20 on an ability check and added all of their bonuses, it is beyond their ability to find so it will remain hidden.
 
•The times above represent at least 2 characters searching.
 
•Two characters can search the walls, floor and ceiling and everything inside of a room up to 30’ x 30’. Larger rooms, or rooms with a large amount of “stuff” may take longer. Rooms smaller than 30’ x 30’ still take the indicated time to search.
 
•A single character searching the same room will take twice as long.
 
•More than two characters searching the room do not reduce the time any further unless it is a very large room.
 
•Characters that are searching can perform no other activities.
 
•Characters that are not searching can be on the lookout for monsters. One character can watch only one entrance without penalty. If a monster approaches the group through an entrance that is being watched, the Dexterity (Stealth) check of that character will be used against the Wisdom (Perception) checks of any monsters that are actively searching for you, and against the passive Wisdom (Perception) scores of any monsters that aren’t searching.

# TRAPS
MAGICAL TRAPS
These traps are arcane in nature, radiating an aura that is perceivable by those trained in it. Be careful with these, as most of them are invisible to the naked eye. Magical traps can be further broken down into various classes - glyphs, proximity, or situational
Glyphs are written with a special ink or are magically carved into an object, as that upon facing closely to the glyph will activate it. Proximity magical traps activate only when a creature, or perhaps certain creatures get within range of it, like an elf getting too close to a sword. Situational magical traps activate whenever you do something specific, such as opening a chest.
GLYPH TRAPS
Detecting one of these types of traps is difficult, but you can sense them with a find trap spell or enhancing your eyes to truesight. If a special ink is used, wiping it away will not deactivate it. Some sort of residue remover will work wonders, but again it depends on the type of ink.
 
Engraved glyphs are a little harder to work with.
Depending on the type, simply slicing through the glyph will be enough to destroy it. I've seen some where it was carved into an adamantine door!
ATTRACTION GLYPH
Now I know what you're thinking. How can falling in love be a trap? Well have you ever heard of marriage? Exactly. Well, this has nothing to do with love at all, but rather metallic items being stuck to the glyph itself. Its a bit of a problem when the key you need gets pulled out of your hands onto the other side of a lava pit!
Whenever this activates, any metallic items within 15 feet of it is pulled toward the center of the glyph, at a speed of 30 feet per turn. A Strength saving throw is required to hold onto the items. If a creature is wearing armor that mostly consists of metal and weighs under 200 pounds fails their saving throw, they are attracted to the glyph. Once on it, the creature is prone and restricted.
FLASH GLYPH
One of the many glyphs that can be found is the Flash glyph. Whenever this activates, any creature within 10 feet of it has their vision disoriented. A Constitution saving throw must be made, with creatures that fail being blinded for 1 minute.
No damage is done from this type of trap, but it sure is annoying when you find an ancient grimoire and this is in the middle of the book!
LEECH GLYPH
Oh, this is a bugger! Ever had your magical ability removed from you before? Don't ever do it. This is one of the few things that can take it from you. Whenever this activates, any creature within 10 feet of it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature cannot use any magical spells or spell-like abilities for 1 minute. Magical items within this radius are also considered nonmagical for the duration.
One time, we were trying to run from this pack of owlbears in an abandoned dungeon, right? Well I won't point out any names, but someone (Aoth Rein) stepped on this which was on the ground. Well we got trapped in a dead end, cornered by these beasts. Let me tell you, that was not fun! 
PARANOIA GLYPH
How could I forget this one? Oh, I messed up big time when I touched this. I became afraid of mice! Mice! Do you know how embarrassing it is, when you've delved deeper than any person before, have talked dragons out of burning villages, and conversed with unfathomable horrors?
Whenever this activates, all creatures within 10 feet of it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature becomes afraid of harmless things around it, overthinking any possible situation, and grows untrust among the party. This effect lasts for ldlO minutes.
STASIS GLYPH
This one is a pain! Being affected by this can certainly cause many problems, as once you're caught, you can't move! Whenever this activates, any creature within 5 feet of it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature is paralyzed for 1 minute.
This is another glyph that doesn't do any damage by itself, but I have heard about these being used with falling ceilings that slowly make their way down. People go splat under pressure; did you know that?
PROXIMITY TRAPS
How can someone deactivate a trap that triggers when you get too close? The answer is that you don't, honestly. What you should do is instead cause some motion to activate it, such as throwing some pebbles or letting loose a live rat. Or, you can make the big, bully guy go in first to activate it. I'm not judging! Without doing so, well.. You can say good-bye to the world
These traps are very difficult to find and not for the faint of heart either. They activate whenever a creature gets within sight or within range. Some examples of this the arcane eye which sees out in a line, or the clairvoyance spell in which someone gets within a certain distance. On top of that, darkvision placed on a trap can sense creatures in the dark, out to 60 feet in order to trigger the spell Lastly, a see invisibility spell can be cast, or a true sight spell so they can see if you are hidden, or if you're on a different plane of existence!
ALARM
Widely known as a spell already, this is famous for protecting objects that you want out of other people's hands. The alarm spell is casted on an object, and when you do cast it, you can select a number of people that can interact with the object without setting off the alarm. In addition, you can make the alarm heard to all, or just the people you select in their mind!
Salazar Basha and I went into a crypt of ooze covered skeletons, and found a sword that had not rusted throughout the ages. It was in the hand of a king on a throne, now entirely skeleton. As soon as we touched it, the skeletons made a dead sprint towards us! Get it? Dead sprint9 Hey, I never said my jokes were funny.
 
COMBUSTING SUCK SPIKES
This, this one is a mighty danger. It starts off just as a simple ascension or descension on a stone floor. All of a sudden, the stone is covered in a thick layer of grease, risking you fall prone and slide to the bottom. As if that wasn't bad enough, a flame lights the grease, so if you aren't falling, you'll be caught on fire! Additionally, if you are sliding, there are spikes that form at the bottom of the hallway! If I had to recall on it, I would say the spells are grease, produce flame and perhaps spike growth...
Stay away from this one!
HUNGRY ARMS
As soon as you enter the area, tentacles of unknown horror tear through the air, lashing out at anyone unfortunate enough to be near. Upon further inspection, I have found that the spell must be arms ofhadar, an unfathomable beast from the Far Realms.
ILLUMINATING PRESENCE
This one is not so much a trap, but can startle you at first! Whenever you come within range of an object, it brightens a few torches so that you may see! I have identified what actually activates, and it seems to be the dancing lights cantrip. The first time I saw this, I was walking into an ancient keep of a lost civilization, where the torches would emit light along the hallway.
MISSILES IN THE DARK
With the ability of seeing out in darkness, this magical trap will fire 3 magic missiles, automatically hitting any creature it sees fit. This is quite dangerous, as I've lost many an ally when we were first travelling out in search of fortune.
MOLTEN METAL
Quite an awful trick, I will admit. As soon as you enter the room, the walls and floor are made of metal But after a few seconds, the metal changes from a cold, dark color to a heated yellow and red! You will realize that the room is going to bum you alive if you don't get out! That must have been a heat metal spell..
RADIATING WEAPONS
Have you seen a bright flash of light, only to realize that it is a weapon? Some traps will conjure one of these weapons. I've seen swords, spears and even maces become real! It must have been a spiritual weapon spell that was cast, I'm confident that it was. That reminds me of the time I went into the burial grounds full of heroes, where we were searching for Dothan Sabrina, a famous paladin...
SITUATIONAL TRAPS
These traps are triggered by really specific conditions, such as being an elf and walking into the room, or being the age of 347. Another trigger can be that you simply interacting with something, which is veiy complicated unless you know exactly what you are doing. Stay safe! 
COMPACT HALLWAY
Imagine that the hall you are walking down gets closer and tighter, to the point that you can't budge forward How would you get through? Corporal Redbloom found out the hard way...
In order to truly disable this magical hallway, you have to keep travelling in, to the point that you are stuck and cannot even back out. Once you do, you will soon realize that the hallway was just an illusion! It was really just as big as normal!
FORGE OF GEMS
Can you believe that Father Time actually exists? If you don't believe me, well I have news for you. I met him! Actually, that is sort of why I am mentioning this trap now...
An efreeti forge, crafted in the City of Brass, made out of the very same metaL In it is a fire that flickers softly, but gives no heat. Upon further investigation, the charcoal is actually small rubies. Simply taking from the forge is what leads to your demise, though... Attempting to take a gem will require a Dexterity saving throw, as a fireball centered from the mouth of the forge is released
If you instead drop a gem into the forge, the spirits of the efreeti manifest, blessing you with resistance to fire damage.
MANIFESTED MIRROR
I wouldn't call this one a trap, but rather a difficult one to process. So mirrors reflect things back into out eyes, correct? Well, this mirror reflects the semi-truth into the gazer. Objects that are hidden in the room, such as secret doors are revealed in the room, but may not be interacted with.
So how do you use that mirror then? Well, you have to go through it. The only difficulty is that your reflection blacks your path. Creatures that don't have a reflect, such as vampires, can freely enter and exit at their will
ROGUE'S BANE
Some traps are designed for certain... Professions. A small gearbox often is connected to a mechanical trap, and the trap disabler will do their job. But what happens when they do their job, but that is what causes the activation?
In times like this, the disabled device actually triggers the magic to take effect. I've seen it where doors lock because of this, or poisonous gas clouds the room.
TELEPORTATION ROOM
Entering this room will lead you to different chambers, in which you will be unfamiliar with. As soon as the magically rigged item is interacted with, all doors slam shut, and once opened will reveal that the halls outside look much different. Why? Because the characters themselves had their entire room teleport over to a new location.
I remember one time, we were exploring this location called the Tomb of Vrouk'zous the Foul in the Underdark. We slipped into one room, where a chest lay in the center. Well, the rogue searched it in it's entirely for traps, but couldn't find any! As soon as it was opened, we all lurched backwards, landed on our butts and the doors locked shut! As soon as I felt I was done spinning, I opened the door to get out and I didn't recognize anything!
 
MECHANICAL TRAPS
Mechanical traps vary widely, being able to controlled from an input device, such as a pressure plate or trip wire, all the way to being carved into something such as a pit trap. As such, I have organized these into input devices, as most pit traps are common knowledge.
INPUT DEVICES
Input devices are what needs to be tampered with in order to activate the trap itself. Things such as a trip wire being broken or a light source having a shadow casted are examples.
What is great about these traps is that they are easily created, requiring minimal set up time and can be taken down for transport. On the other hand, being taken down is a way to lose the trap itself from sticky fingers.
DOOR HINGE
Simply opening a door will trigger a trap. You can do so by having objects attached to the top of the door to tip, or place a trip wire in the hinge so that it will be cut when opened
LIGHT INTERRUPTION
A light source that is constant may look like an ordinary torch, but having a small sensor that picks up the light across the room is a wonderous little item. Whenever the light no longer shines on the sensor, its switch will activate, releasing the trap. These are near impossible to detect, as getting close to it may cast your shadow on it, and the trap will trigger.
NOISE MAKER
This isn't so much an input device but more to keep you aware of their presence. Simply hanging many chains in a hallway can do so, as it will be difficult to pass without bumping into them. Another way to do so is have a bell attached to a door, so that when it opens, it will ring out.
PRESSURE PLATE
A weight sensitive tile or plate has a switch underneath, which can snip a long trip wire or the like. Simply pushing on the pressure plate with a pole will click the switch, which can activate the trap.
TRIPWIRE
Made of fishing line or even heavy duty hempen rope, whenever the line is broken or pulled tight, the release will occur. Unfortunately, these can be simply cut from far away, as long as you can spot them!
NATURE TRAPS
Finally, the wilderness has many, many harmful plants and such that exploring may prove more dangerous than you can handle. Jungles are filled with poisonous plants, rivers may be flooded with sinking mud, boulders may fall from cliff sides. 
Be aware of your surroundings! Always pay attention to what is around you. Don't try to be a hero, and don't be a fool You cannot save anyone or get treasure if you don't even make it to your destination!
ARCANE STORM
Arcane weather tampering is an impressive feat, but also a costly one. With the arcane power still infused with the clouds, the storm will eventually head away, only to bring a different destruction. When this storm occurs, the rain causes damage. Anyone caught in its rain must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes ld6 force damage. This saving throw must be repeated at the start of every round On a successful saving throw, the creature takes half damage.
This location that the storm is in is considered a pocket of wild magic. Any spell casted within this area must have a percentile dice roll, following the Wild Surge Table on page 104 in the Player's Handbook.
This storm lasts for ld4 hours.
HOT PIT
Sometimes, the world around us is full wonder and danger, which captivates me. Once such instance is what I call the hot pit, where massive ponds and lakes instantly heat to the point that they boil When this occurs, you need to get out right away, as many people who wander into a hot pit receive bums, if they make it at all!
With a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Survival) check, you can tell the symptoms of a hot pit about to heat up. Roughly 30 seconds before the heat starts, the water clouds to a deep gray, with the heavy smell of salt that hangs in the air. 15 seconds before the heat begins, the water slowly shakes, rippling on the surface.
All those caught in the water must make a Constitution saving throw, with the DC set at 16. On a failure, the creature takes 4d6 fire damage as the water scalds you, and a level of exhaustion. At the start of every turn, any creature in the water receives an additional 4d6 fire damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage for the round that the saving throw occurs.
Flying creatures within 80 feet above the hot pit must also make the Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 4d6 fire damage, one level of exhaustion and are falling at a rate of 60 feet per turn.
Once 5 rounds have occurred, the water settles down, and instantly cools.
JAWS OF DOOM
We all know the little tiny plants that eat common pests, correct? Jaws of Doom are similar plants, but on a much more massive scale. Their aroma entices many, where it smells of cooking meat with garlic spice. They look like wide, flat bushes with brown fur on top that takes up a 10 foot space, appearing like mold Because of this, many lost adventurers looking for food will wander over, stepping on top of the plant, and be swallowed up, slowly dissolved
Whenever a creature steps on the plant, they must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the plant springs up and swallows the creature. The creature is grappled and can make a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to break free at the end of its turn. A grappled creature takes 2d6 acid damage at the start of their turn.
 
A creature can recognize the plant with a DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) or Intelligence (Nature) check.
SWAMP ROT
Deep in the swamps, a mist consumes the land during the night. For some strange reason, the mist stays around 10 feet away from any fire source, but will spread around it. If a creature breathes in the mist at any moment, the creature must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. The symptoms do not show up until ld8 hours later.
On a failure, the creature's hit point maximum is reduced by their Constitution modifier per day. If the saving throw is failed by 5 or more, the creature also gains a level of exhaustion. This level of exhaustion does not reduce by taking a long rest. On a successful saving throw, the creature cannot be affected by swamp rot for 24 hours.
Being affected by another cause of swamp rot will require another Constitution saving throw. Additional failures have their penalties stack.
After ld4 days, the symptoms go away and are no longer affected by swamp rot. A lesser restoration or similar spell will remove this disease.
VINE FLOORING
The floor of a jungle has winding layer of vines, but sometimes that is the only thing for flooring, giving a false sense of security. A successful DC 17 Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Survival) check will allow the person to notice that there is no ground underneath. Any creature over 50 pounds that steps on the vines must make a Dexterity saving throw, with the DC set at 15. On a failure, the creature falls 10 feet but is restrained, hanging over the pit or cliffside below them. On a success, the creature holds their footing.
INKTABLE
Ink	Application DC
Rust Powder	10
Squid Ink	11
Coodberry Juice	12
Oak Tree Water	1 3
Humanoid Blood	14
Basilisk Venom	1 5
Crushed White Scale Paste	16
Wyvern Poison	17
Purple Worm Poison	18

SPECIAL INKS
Special inks can be harvested and used for different glyphs. Each special ink has difficulty being wiped and cleaned away, unless a specific remover is applied to it, or a procedure happens.
It seems the rarer and more valuable the ink used, the riskier the ink is, as it may decay or fall apart. Down below is an Ink Table that tells the cost of the ink and the DC of creating the glyph. Whenever you apply the ink, you must make a Dexterity (Painter's Tools) check.
BASIUSK VENOM
How could you possibly harvest this at all? It is incredibly difficult to survive a basilisk attack, but to render it unable to fight and then get the venom without getting cut at all? That is some serious talent. The only thing that I know of that would get rid of basilisk venom is goat milk. Basilisk venom costs 500 gp per vial
CRUSHED WHITE SCALE PASTE
The process of grinding white dragon scales is a labor intensive one, where many hours can be spent. At the end of it, you have a substance that seems as a mixture between chalk and flour. Stirring this powder into a small vial of water creates a paste that can be applied One of the few things that removes white scale paste is an open flame applied to it. One vial of this paste costs as much as 300 gp.
GOODBERRY JUICE
Made from goodberries that have been pulverized in a pestle and mortar, this can easy be applied but dries veiy quickly. Because of its rich red color, it is also often used to dye clothing. Goodberry juice seems to wash away with oil, oddly enough. You can get a flask of goodberry juice for 5 gp.
HUMANOID BLOOD
If you are in desperate need, you can slice open your own hand and draw with the blood if need be. I won't judge, I have also been put into that same position! A simple wash rag can wipe away the blood though.
OAK TREE WATER
Water that is found in the trunk of a mighty oak can be gathered easily, if you tap into it. Unfortunately, mighty oaks are usually in groves, protected by druid circles to prevent harm. This clear liquid applies just like any other water, and dries with a clear, wax-like residue. The only way to really get rid of oak tree water is with anything that has a high alcohol content. A vial of oak tree water goes for around the price of 30 gp.
PURPLE WORM POISON
Purple worms are massive, burrowing earth worms that of course, are the purple variety. Their poison is so deadly that single drops can kill a humanoid instantly. To gather any of this poison, now that is an adventure in itself! Being that it burrows, it only makes sense that rock will absorb and neutralize this poison. A single vial of purple worm poison goes as high as 2,000 gp!
 
RUST POWDER
Old swords and armor are usually junk, as their rusted dull edge is in too bad of a condition. If this rust is gathered and suspended in water, it can easily be applied to a surface. To get rid of use, it seems that a splash of acid will remove it, but the acid might also eat away at the surface. Rust powder can be purchased for about 5 gp, but most smiths will give it away for free.
SQ,UID INK
Squid ink is plentiful in the world without much trouble to get, especially on the coast! Head to your nearest fish market in port, and I'm sure you can gather quite a bit! Squid ink can easily be removed by wiping it away with a wet cloth. Ajar of ink which is one ounce, costs only 10 gp. What a steal!
WYVERN POISON
An incredible feat in itself is to survive seeing a wyvern. It is another to gather the poison of a wyvern and apply it. Personally, I have only heard tales of such, and never personally done it. One of the few things that neutralize wyvern poison is the plant called Wyvern's Bane, which grows on certain mountain ranges. Wyvern venom costs 1,200 gp per vial
CREATING TRAPS
So you want to learn the art of trapmaking, huh? It is an interesting topic, but I can teach you. Down below are some notes I have jotted down in order to further your knowledge!
MAGICAL TRAP CREATION
In order to create a magical trap, you need to come up with the way that the device will activate, either from glyphs or proximity. Use the following Arcane Spell Activation table in order to find the cost of the activation. If it is a spell, you must spend the spell slot and any additional material component costs.
The Perception DC is to check against a creature that is hidden from a Dexterity (Stealth) check. If a creature is not hiding, the spell automatically succeeds in finding the creature.
If it is a glyph, use the Glyph Spell Activation table below in order to find the difficulty in creating it on certain objects. This difficulty is represented by a DC, which is made by a Dexterity (Woodcarver's Tools) Dexterity (Mason's Tools) or Dexterity (Smith's Tools) If the glyph is made of ink, you must pay the cost of the ink, found in the Special Inks section.

DC FOR SAVES AND DISARMING
Once you have established the activation requirements or drawn or carved the glyph, you can now imbue some magic into the object.
The requirements to do so are shown by spell slots, giving a DC for the trap to save against the spell or glyph. Glyphs themselves require a spell slot to infuse the arcane energy into it, which you can select in order to get the appropriate DC.
GLYPH SPELL ACTIVATION
Material	DC	Time
Wood	10	1 Minute
Stone	14	10 minutes
Iron	16	1 Hour
Another Metal	18	2 Hours
Adamantine	20	4 Hours


When you use a spell slot, you can select a spell that you wish the trap to cast when activated. When doing so, you must expend material component costs if the spell requires to. Spells that have a range will be firing at the creature that triggers the trap. If a spell is touch based, then the spell triggers whenever a creature touches the object. If the spell requires a saving throw and has an area, treat the object like the center of the spell for calculating the spell
In addition, there is a DC to disarm the arcane trap or glyph without setting it off, which can be done with an Intelligence (Arcana) check.


MECHANICAL TRAP CREATION
Not everyone can cast spells which is just as fine, but with some simple ingenuity, a person with some time on their hands can be a valuable assett when it comes to this. There are a few steps that must be taken, but be warned that most traps may need reset.
The input device is often hidden, which is shown by the Stealth DC on the Mechanical Input Device table. This is contested by a character's Wisdom (Perception) check.
Next to that is the Disable DC column, where it is the DC required to disable the input device with a Dexterity (Thieves’ Tools) check.
After that is the Set Up Time column. This is the amount of time it takes to put together one of these traps that use this input device.
Lastly is the Reset column. Whenever your trap activates, it may be possible for the trap to automatically reset itself, or you may need to manually set it again



MECHANICAL INPUT DEVICE
Activation	Stealth DC	Disable DC	Set Up Time	Reset
Noise Maker	10	10	1 Minute	Automatic
Trip Wire	14	12	1 Minute	Manual
Door Hinge	16	1 5	3 Minutes	Depends
Pressure Plate	19	1 5	10 Minutes	Depends
Light Interruption	25	20	30 Minutes	Depends



LANGUAGE BARRIERS
Sometimes, a character does not know a language that is spoken in front of them. A character might attempt to understand the language, or recall a few words that they might have heard before. The creature must make an Intelligence (History) check. The DC is 15 for a standard language, or 20 for an exotic language.
On a success, the creature can understand one or two key words that the creature had said
LONG REST TO LEVEL UP
Whenever a character has enough experience to increase their level, the character must finish a long rest to increase their level This will prevent the level increase in a hostile environment.
LICHDOM ASCENSION 

 

o live forever is the dream of many people. You would never worry about the ever present threat of death. The closest that most mortals can be to immortal is being an elf, as they have the ability to live a long life of near 750 years. Another way is through powerful artifacts, one of which is the Ring of Winter, rumored to be on Artus Cimber. Lastly, you could live forever by dying, and coming back as an undead monstrosity. Two forms of this undeath can be found - lichdom or vampirism. In this chapter, I will go over how to become the undead spellcaster, known as a lich.
LICHES AND THEIR LICHDOM
A lich is a supremely powerful arcane spellcaster, and are almost always eviL An exception to this is the baelnom, which are elves that undergo this transformation in order to protect their community.
Liches don't exactly live, but merely exist. This occurs when a wizard or sorcerer seal their soul into an object known as a phylactery. This is no easy task - binding your soul to an object takes a heavy toll on the body, and has a risk of permanently destroying the item, or worse.
After the phylactery has received the soul, the phylactery will require additional souls to consume. Without a consistent source of souls to feed off of, the phylactery will eventually consume the liches soul, then destroy itself. Without their soul, a lich will be destroyed
To be a lich is almost a certain malignant fate. What makes a person humane is their soul Without that, they are merely a selfish husk of a body, free to do whatever they please. With an eternity to live forever, a liches scheme may take centuries to come into fruition. What you choose to do with your time and research is up to you, but be aware that those who side with goodness may hunt you down.
LICHDOM PREREQUISITES
To begin the path of lichdom, the aspiring spellcaster must be able to cast at least 6th level spells. The source of magic does not matter, although clerics of righteous deities may find their ability to cast magic taken.
 
After the spellcaster has gained the ability to cast a 6th level spell or higher, they must find the dark ritual The knowledge is a well-guarded secret, where only those worthy may find it. Perhaps the ritual must be bargained for by Orcus, or a warlock may receive it from their ancient patron.
This ritual is split into multiple parts. It is incredibly rare to find all components to the ritual at once in one central location, although it is possible. Without all parts, it is impossible to complete the ritual
After completion of the ritual it is not a guarantee that the spellcaster becomes a lich. Permanent death is always a possibility, or even a loss of a sense. If successful the spellcaster will awaken a few days later, enjoying their new unlife, as long as they continuously supply the phylactery with souls, and keep it safe.
CREATING THE PHYLACTERY
The phylactery is the object that holds the soul allowing the body to progress in age, but not die. If a liches body is destroyed, the phylactery will emit a wafting dark smoke, reforming the liches body over the course of a few days.
A spellcaster cannot purchase an item to use as a phylactery. Instead, they must craft an item of their choice. The cost of creating this phylactery must be at least 50,000 gp worth of materials, and must use one drop of their fresh blood every day in the process. Doing do will allow the phylactery to know which soul to preserve.
In order to craft the phylactery, the spellcaster must succeed on a DC 25 Smith's Tools or Tinker's Tools check.
On a failure of 21 to 24, the crafting of the phylactery will take an additional year for every number the check had failed by. If the check failure is by 5 or greater, the phylactery crafting is unsuccessful
After the phylactery has been successfully created, it must be inscribed with arcane sigils. To do so, the spellcaster must mark the phylactery with at least 5,000 gp of silver.
Upon completion of the arcane sigils, the spellcaster is mentally linked to their phylactery. In addition, they can see their phylactery as if they had cast scrying, without expending a spell slot. 
Your phylactery has the following statistics:
•	The phylactery has an AC of 10.
•	The phylactery has 25 HP.
•	The phylactery has resistance to all damage except force damage.
•	The phylactery loses one hit point per day that it does not have a soul to feed on. If its hit points reaches 0, it will be destroyed, along with the soul of the lich.
As long as the liches phylactery remains, the lich can have their body reform after ldlO days. If a lich does not have a phylactery, they can spend their time performing the same ritual to create their phylactery. If the lich does not have a phylactery whenever their body is destroyed, both their body and soul are consumed by the ShadowfelL Only divine intervention can restore a lich in this way.
SOUL ACQUISITION
After the phylactery has been created, and the silver sigils have been inscribed, it is ready to receive the spellcasters soul The phylactery will remain open for 10 days. Without acquiring a soul, it will close off and must be reattempted again.
In order to allow the phylactery to receive your soul you must make a DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check. On a success, the soul is open to receive the soul
On a failure of 16 to 19, the phylactery remains closed and will not accept a soul and must be attempted after one day has passed On a failure of 11 to 15, the phylactery will remain closed off from accepting souls for ten days. On a failure of 10 or lower, the phylactery is destroyed
THE FOUL POTION
Once the phylactery has been completed the next step is to create the vile poison that the spellcaster will consume. This poison is an unholy matrimony of life and death - the physical representation of undeath.
This concoction is made of numerous abominations. It must be consumed during the ritual in order to convert into a lich. This process is almost certain to kill whoever drinks it, and is the likely cause of loss in a liches senses.
In order to create this poison, you must use at least five of the following ingredients below:
A vial of wyvem blood A vial of manticore venom A vial of an elder brain's brine A vial of roper saliva A vial of gorgon blood A vial of purple wurm poison A gram of crushed and dried belladonna A gram of rot grub eggs A gram of unicorn horn powder A drop of gelatinous cube acid A ghoul's finger nail A couatl's feather
The heart of a good-aligned humanoid The humanoid must have been sacrificed within the past day. The heart is used as the container of the poison, and must be consumed after drinking the poison in order to be used as an ingredient.
 
THE ASCENSION RITUAL
Finally, when the phylactery is able to receive souls, and the potion is consumed can the ritual begin. The ritual consists of an area that is high in magical concentration. Examples of this may be in a wizard's tower, or an area of faerzress in the Underdark.
This area must be prepared with sigils of binding, written in your blood To do so, you must succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check. On a failure, the sigils must be removed and reapplied the next day. In the center of the arcane sigils must be the phylactery.
Once the sigils are complete and the check is a success, the runes will begin to glow with an eerie green. The glowing will continue for one minute, afterwards it will require another application of blood on the next day.
During the glowing, the thick, black ooze of the poison will also glow the same green. The poison must be consumed within the minute of the arcane markings beginning to glow. Failure to consume all of the poison before the glowing ends will result in a 50% chance of entering a coma for ld6+l days, or immediate death without transforming into a lich.
If the spellcaster successfully consumes the poison within the minute, roll on the Success to Drink Table. If the ritual was under the light of a full moon, or during a new moon, add 10 to the roll For each additional ingredient in the poison after the first five, add an additional 5 to the roll

IMMEDIATE DEATH
Upon consumption of the poison, the drinker is immediately killed within 5 rounds. During this time, the phylactery will attempt to retrieve the soul before it goes to the afterlife.
If the roll determined that it was a failure, the soul passes onto the afterlife, determined by the spellcaster's alignment. Due to the horrendous acts that the spellcaster did during the ritual, they are most likely not of good-alignment.
If the roll determined that the death led to a successful retrieval of the soul, the spellcaster awakens as a light at the next dawn.
COMA
Upon consumption of the poison, the drinker falls into a coma within 5 rounds. During this time, the phylactery will attempt to steal the soul of the spellcaster, ripping it from the unconscious body.
The spellcaster is unconscious for ld6+l days. No magical spells can reverse this effect. If the roll determined a failure, the spellcaster will awaken without being transformed into a lich.
If the roll determined a success, then the spellcaster will awaken, transformed into a lich.
PERMANENT HANDICAP
Upon consumption of the poison, the drinker falls into a coma within 5 rounds. During this time, the phylactery will attempt to steal the soul of the the spellcaster. The combination of ripping the soul out of the body and the foul nature of the poison will permanently affect the lich.
The spellcaster will awaken within Ы6+1 days. In addition, roll on the Permanent Handicap Table.
PERMANENT HANDICAP
ld4 Outcome
1	The lich is mute
2	The lich is paralyzed in their hands
3	The lich is deafened
4	The lich is blinded
 
BEING A LICH
As a lich, you gain the following properties:
•	You are an Undead humanoid
•	You have advantage against any effect that turns undead
•	Your phylactery will create another body for you within ldlO days if your body is destroyed
•	You can make one melee spell attack against a creature. The creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or be paralyzed for one minute. The creature can repeat this saving throw at end of each of its turns, ending the effect.
During your time as a lich, you must feed your phylactery souls in order to maintain its state. To do this, the phylactery will automatically retrieve souls by any creature that has died within 300 feet of it. The phylactery will feed on the soul for a number of weeks, equal to the creature's CR.
LEGENDARY AND LAIR ACTIONS
Normally, liches found elsewhere would have lair actions and legendary actions. This takes many decades at the very least to obtain the ability to do this! Due the becoming a lich recently, you do not have the ability to use lair or legendary actions at this time.
