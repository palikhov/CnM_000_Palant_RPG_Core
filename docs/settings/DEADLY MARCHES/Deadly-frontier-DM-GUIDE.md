# DM Guidelines

## Resolving Tasks

In the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS® game, a Dungeon Master must take a number of roles, all at the same time. A DM serves as a referee, interpreting the rules and resolving any conflicts that arise because of them. The DM builds the world, creates adventures, and places monsters and treasure. The DM is the characters’ eyes and ears, describing what the characters can see and hear to the players.
The first rule of being a good DM is to remember that the rules are a tool that you and the players use to have a good time. The rules aren’t in charge. You, the DM, are the one in charge of the game. Guide the play experience and the use of the rules so that as many of your players have a good time as possible. There will be setbacks, such as a character being slain by an unlucky die roll, but look for ways to turn setbacks into interesting complications in the game’s story.

The second rule is to remember that the DM’s power comes with responsibility. Be fair and impartial with the players. Don’t force your story upon them or give them a game where their choices don’t matter. By the same token, challenge their characters with deadly monsters, fiendish traps, and vexing puzzles. A good DM is no pushover, but a good DM is also never simply out to slaughter the characters.

## When to Use Dice

Characters in the D&D game frequently attempt a tremendous variety of tasks, from running across a swinging rope bridge to talking their way out of a sticky spot with an orc chieftain. All these tasks are resolved in an interaction between you (the DM] and the player whose character is attempting the task.

When a player wants to take an action, it’s often appropriate to just let the action succeed. A character doesn’t normally need to make a Dexterity check to walk across an empty room, or a Charisma check to order a mug of ale in a tavern. Only call for a roll if you think it’s worth taking the time for the rules to come into the flow of the game. Ask yourself two questions to aid your decision.
Is the action being taken so easy, so free of stress or conflict, or so appropriate to the situation that there should be no chance of failure? “So easy” should take into account the ability score associated with the intended action. It’s easy for someone with a Strength score of 18 to flip over a table, though not easy for someone with a Strength score of 9.

Is the action being taken so inappropriate or impossible that it would never work? Hitting the moon with an arrow is, for instance, impossible in almost any circumstance.

If the answer to both of these questions is no, some kind of roll is appropriate.


## Шаблон истории (приключения)

ВАЖНО! Для описания использовать наметки Александриана и Hack&Slash

Приключение - история с началом и концом, в которой протагонисты (персонажи игроков) стремятся достичь определенных целей, встречая сопротивление и/или проходя испытания. В конце концов протагонисты преуспевают в достижении целей или терпят поражение и приключение заканчивается.

Название

Обычно название приключению дается в конце создания приключения. Можно вообще не давать название если не придумывается.

Цели

Основные цели протагонистов.

Завязка

События, с которых начинается приключение. Здесь обычно прописывается получение задания от "квестодателя", или событие, которое запускает приключение (например нападение варваров на Мертвые снега)

Мотивация

Почему участники приключения заинтересованы в этом приключении? Мотивация состоит из двух частей
1) Мотивация персонажей. Почему персонажи захотят участвовать в этом приключении?
2) Мотивация игроков. Почему игроки захотят участвовать в этом приключении?

# Exploration

## Hazards
Is there a chance that failing a task might lead to a disastrous outcome for the character? You decide whether a hazard applies to a particular ability check and when the hazard applies.

A hazard might affect a character who fails an ability check. For example, a character who attempts and fails a Strength (Athletics] check to jump across a pit that he or she couldn’t normally clear probably falls into the pit. Sometimes, though, a hazard kicks in only if the character misses the ability check’s DC (or loses a contest] by a significant margin, such as 5 or 10. Examples of hazards can be found in the “Tasks and Skills” section.

### Requirements

A task might require a specific tool or circumstance for a character to have any chance of success. For example, you might need a magnifying glass to accurately appraise a gem.

A character who cannot meet the requirements for a task automatically fails. One who meets them can attempt an ability check as normal for the task.

You can decide to waive this requirement, but the task should be hard to complete without it. You might give the character disadvantage on the ability check, or set the DC higher than you would for a character who met the requirement.

Otherwise, requirements should come up only rarely. Use them to encourage the players to come up with clever solutions, not to punish them for trying to do interesting things.

## Engaging the Players

As a DM, you could memorize these guidelines, apply them flawlessly, and still miss out on the point of D&D. Unlike some other games, D&D is a flexible set of guidelines, not a rigid set of laws.

When you ask a player to make an ability check, an attack, or a saving throw, you first should focus on engaging the players’ imaginations. Describe the scene to them, and pull in details such as sights, sounds, and even smells to make the action vivid.
More important, you want the players to become fully engaged in the game. Reward inventive players who look beyond game options to describe their characters’ actions. Roleplaying games stand out from other types of games because they allow for this type of creativity. Encourage it whenever you can.

The easiest way to do so is to make imaginative solutions the easiest path to success for the adventurers. Consider the following options.

Ability Checks. When a player makes an ability check, invite him or her to describe the character’s action. If the player makes clever use of the situation in the description, consider either granting an automatic success or advantage on the ability check.
Contests. In a contest, an ingenious description that points to a key advantage that a character might gain could lead you to grant the character advantage on the check.

Attacks and Saving Throws. A colorful description is nice for attacks and saving throws, but should rarely be the avenue to gaining a concrete game benefit, since it is too easy to abuse such an approach. You might have players endlessly describing how they resist a mind flayer’s mind blast or trying to narrate every detail of a sword blow. In most cases, spells and special abilities serve to grant characters advantage on their attacks and saving throws.

That said, if the situation warrants it, use advantage to grant a character an edge.

Disadvantage. Not every idea is a good one. A character might try to win the prince’s favor by bragging about all the bandits he or she slew, not realizing that the prince is an avowed pacifist. If an idea backfires on a player, apply disadvantage to the ability check or attack.

## Кульминация

Это самая драматичная сцена приключения. Часто именно от нее зависит исход приключения и развязка.

## Multiple Ability Checks

Sometimes a character fails an ability check and wants to try again. You have a couple of options in this case.

In most cases, the character can simply try again. The only real cost is the time it takes. The character keeps trying and, after enough time passes, eventually succeeds. To speed things up, you can assume that a character can automatically succeed at a task if he or she spends twenty times the normal amount of time needed to complete it. This exception does not allow a character to turn an impossible task into a successful one.

In other cases, the first failure renders subsequent ability checks impossible. For instance, a rogue tries to trick a town guard into thinking that the group members are undercover agents of the king. The rogue loses the contest of Charisma (Deception] against Wisdom. The same lie told again clearly won’t work.

Dungeon Adventuring
It should come as no surprise that dungeons, subterranean complexes of maze-like passages and chambers, play a key role in DUNGEONS & DRAGONS. Most adventures feature at least one dungeon, and it's possible to set a campaign entirely within an enormous, sprawling dungeon that can take characters from 1st to 20th level.
This section provides a turn-based system for exploring a dungeon. The rules address how to move through and investigate a dungeon, the tasks that characters can undertake while they explore, and how those tasks are performed.
Your Dungeon Map
Before the characters can explore your dungeon, you need to have a map that outlines its key geographic features and terrain.
A dungeon can range in size from a few chambers beneath a ruined temple to a huge complex of rooms and passages that extends hundreds of feet below the earth. It's best to use graph paper to map your dungeon, with each square on the paper representing an area of 10 feet by 10 feet.
You track the characters' movement on your map to determine what sort of obstacles and monsters they encounter. Your adventure notes should indicate the contents of key chambers and passages in the dungeon.
Light. Darkness might be the default condition inside an underground complex, but your dungeon can still have plenty of light sources. Most inhabited areas might be illuminated to some extent; even creatures that can see in the dark still use fire for warmth, cooking, and defense.
 
At the other end of the spectrum, many subterranean creatures, including undead, have no need for light, either because they have darkvision or because they don't rely on sight. In regions where these creatures operate, the characters must bring their own light sources.
Dungeon Features
At its most basic, a dungeon is composed of spaces that are enclosed by walls and separated from one another by doors and other barriers. It has other features, such as traps and portcullises, that further set it apart from aboveground adventuring environments.
Walls. The walls in a dungeon can be thick, natural stone formations or manufactured structures (usually wooden] built to subdivide large chambers.
Walls have hit points and can be destroyed. A creature can break through a 5-foot-square section of wall by succeeding on a Strength check with a DC equal to the wall's current hit points. The hit points and break DC for a section of wall are determined by its material and thickness.
Hit Points/Inch of Thickness
60
5
30
30
10
Doors. Intelligent dungeon inhabitants will barricade or lock doors when possible, especially if they expect attackers. The DC to break down a door depends on the materials used to create it. In addition, characters can attack doors in an attempt to batter them down. The Strength DC to break down a door equals its current hit points.
Door Material Hit Points
Adamantine	120
Glass	5
Iron	60
Stone	60
Wood	10
Portcullis. A portcullis is a set of vertical bars reinforced with one or two horizontal bands of iron. A portcullis is dropped to block a passage, 
with a winch and chain used to raise it back up. The big benefit provided by a portcullis is that it blocks a passage while still allowing guards to watch the area beyond and fire arrows or cast spells into it.
A portcullis can be lifted as an action that requires a DC 20 Strength check, or no check if a character can use that action to turn its winch. A creature that makes a DC 25 Strength check can bend the portcullis’s bars apart to allow creatures to pass through it.
Secret Doors. Some doors in a dungeon are crafted to blend into the walls that surround them. An Intelligence (Search] check is required to find clues pointing to the presence of a secret door. The DC is 10, 20, or 30, with higher DCs denoting better craftsmanship. A secret door that has been detected is treated like a normal door of the appropriate material (usually stone].
Traps. Intelligent dungeon dwellers set traps in areas where they expect enemies to approach, while long-forgotten tombs might have traps set hundreds of years ago.
The Dungeon Turn
This is the sequence of play for a minute of travel and exploration in a dungeon.
1.	Travel Pace and Exploration Tasks. The players decide what direction their characters will move in and their travel pace. They also decide on their exploration tasks, chosen from the list under “Exploration Tasks.” The players should also determine their formation (often called “marching order”]: who is in the front, the middle, and the back of the group.
2.	Progress on the Map. Follow the characters’ path on your dungeon map, describing what they see and allowing them to make decisions as they move. The characters might encounter creatures that you have placed in certain locations. If they do so, an interaction or combat encounter ensues.
3.	Random Encounters. Check for random encounters once every 10 minutes. If monsters are encountered, resolve any interaction or combat that occurs between the creatures and the characters.
After performing these steps, go back to the first step and repeat the sequence for another turn.

## Замки и твердыни
 
Возможно, самая распространенная из разрушенных структур, которую можно найти на Ториле - разрушенный замок, выживший как символ королевских амбиций и владения землями. Замки и твердыни Фаэруна - обычно укрепленные здания с огромной физической защитой. Магическая защита также может присутствовать, если замок был в свое время занят способными заклинателями.
 
Разрушенные цитадели обычно занимают стратегическое положение. Как и крепости, они содержали гарнизоны отрядов и арсеналы, заполненные оружием, и иногда служили для сохранения магических артефактов и религиозных реликвий. Некоторые замки также получили известность или славу из-за размещения военных, религиозных и монашеских орденов.

## Башни
 
Разрушенные магические башни рассеяны по всей длине и ширине Фаэруна. Некоторые далеки от цивилизованных областей, другие стоят посреди городов и городков. Будь это шпиль волшебника, магический университет или палата призывания, скрытая глубоко под землей - такая башня, как правило, принадлежала магу великой силы, который использовал ее как дом, библиотеку и лабораторию. Ныне покинутые, эти башни соблазняют любопытных слухами о забытых магических методах, таинственных заклинаниях и изделиях великой силы.
 
Магические башни обеспечивают богатство приключенческих возможностей для тех, кто ищет магической силы и знаний, но опытные авантюристы предпочитают знать, а не предполагать, что владелец покинутой башни мертв. Чрезвычайно мощные волшебники и колдуны, путешествующие на другие планы или даже в другие миры, могут проводить столетия далеко от Торила, но все же башни редко остаются незащищенными. Некоторые такие структуры имеют сигналы тревоги, уведомляющие их владельцев в случае вторжения, а некоторые могут призывать своих владельцев из других измерений, если возникнет такая потребность.
 
Кроме того, некоторые башни, которые кажутся пустынными, не покинуты действительно — их древние владельцы остаются внутри как личи, демиличи или спектральные маги.

## Rumors

In addition to the constant threat posed by the numerous monsters of the Savage Frontier, more insidious perils are manifesting. The Zhentarim seek to extend their influence westward from Llorkh. The Kraken Society, an organization of spies, assassins, and sinister dealers in lore and knowledge, is well ensconced in Luskan and other coastal cities and dreams of subverting inland towns such as Yartar along the Dessarin valley. And the Arcane Brotherhood of Luskan contests the influence of Waterdeep's Lords over the region.
Adventurers come to the Silver Marches to advance the cause of civilization by scouring the land for monster lairs, cleansing dangerous ruins, and driving orc raiders back to their mountain dens. Silverymoon's growth and prosperity have brought new enemies though - the merchants and proud lords of cities such as Luskan and Yartar who grow jealous of the riches that flow through the Silver Marches.

Barbaric Justice: An Uthgardt barbarian of the Black Lion tribe flees into the arms of an adventuring company on the road, pursued by a small party of warriors determined to hunt him down. The fugitive, a young hunter named Thurvald, claims that he is accused of a crime he did not commit, the murder of the shaman Bogohardt at Beorunna's WelL The pursuers, of course, say he's guilty.

If the heroes choose to protect Thurvald, the hunters are out matched by the party and can be driven off with a hard fight. They return in greater force later and trail Thuvald and the heroes wherever they go, even into the city of Silverymoon.

The heroes can simply turn over Thurvald to his pursuers ... but he really is innocent. Thurvald is a shapechanger (a snow leopard), a secret suspected by his tribe and known to the People of the Black Blood. Malar's cultists tried and failed to recruit Thurvald of his own free will, so they murdered the tribal shaman and framed Thurvald. They plan to let the Black Lion tribe inflict its harsh justice on Thurvald and then rescue him before he is killed.

Thurvald knows he was framed and knows the two Malar worshipers are responsible. To prove Thurvald's innocence, the heroes must track down the real murderers and expose their guilt.

Giant Opportunities: Taern Horn blade, the new High Mage of Silverymoon, perceives the arrival of the giants in the Evermoors as a chance to pacify the Silver Marches' western border. Silverymoon seeks agents to enter the Moors, identify and contact the most lawful and powerful giants of the area, and attempt to form an alliance to reduce the giants' threat to Silverymoon and Nesme to the west.

Dark Deeds in Ascore: The ruined dwarven city of Ascore on the border of Anauroch was once the gateway to the realm of Deizoun, a rich seaport on the long-vanished Narrow Sea. An expedition from the City of Shade has set up a temporary camp in the ruins, driving off any adventurers who come to explore the old dwarven city. A survivor from one of these adventuring companies reports that a mighty archmage leads the shade effort, which seems to be centered around a strange pool of liquid shadow surrounded by thirteen odd, pyramid-like structures. What are the shades up to? What might they unleash in their efforts to achieve their objective?

Missing Emissary: Two tendays ago, a wizard escorted by four Everlund rangers went into the High Forest to speak with Turlang about the trees' advance upon Everlund's walls. All contact with the wizard has been lost, though divination spells indicate that the wizard, at least, is still alive. Did the wizard pay the price for delivering bad news to Turlang, or did she fall prey to one of the forest's other perils?

Tribes of the Silver Marches

Black Lion: The Black Lions fear their ancestor mound (Beorunna's Well) as much as they revere it, and perhaps moreso. They do not post guards at Beorunna's Well itself, but rather leave that task to the Red Tiger tribe.

Black Raven: The Black Raven tribe appoints an honor guard of no less than ten warriors (CN human Bbn2) and the same number of giant ravens to remain at Raven Rock at all times. The guardians watch over not only the tribe's ancestor mound, but its sacrificial treasure shrine as well.

Gray Wolf: The Gray Wolf tribe no longer participates in helping the Black Ravens guard Raven Rock.

Red Tiger: Protecting the ancestor mound at Beorunna's Well is a task appointed for the Red Tiger's young members who are about to take their tribal vows. At any given time, three to six young men and women (CG human War1) are guided by a tribal cleric (CN human Clr4 of Uthgar).

Sky Pony: The Sky Pony tribe considers it an honor and a sacred duty to provide a constant guard for its ancestor mound. It considers the watch more ceremonial than practical, however. A trio of tribal warriors (CN human Bbn1) is always on guard at One Stone.

Ghaurin's Hold что под Wildlands Rest содержит бессметные сокровища

"Tell Us Who to Hate": The centaurs of the High Forest have received multiple divinations telling them that they must win a war in the next month or lose their tribe's luck. The divinations specified that the centaurs cannot declare the war themselves -- they have to be told who to war against by a non-centaur who happens to be a member of a PC race. After the PC obliges, the centaurs reveal the second part of the prophecy: The noncentaur who names their enemy must lead them into battle. If the PCs avoid doing their prophetic duty, make sure that the non-centaur NPC who names an enemy picks a group the PCs are friendly with.

The Latest from Silverymoon: Alustriel of the Seven Sisters, the ruler of Silverymoon for 134 years until she stepped down to oversee all the Silver March, encourages stronger bonds between the diverse races of Silverymoon. Marriage and children between the races are still relatively rare, but child-rearing, education, and professional training are often so intermingled that outsiders think of Silverymoon as the place where elves think they're dwarves, dwarves think they're elves, and humans think they're everything.

Tag in the Woods: Giants from the Evermoors chase a small army of orcs out of the moors into the Moonwood. While the orcs play the mice to the giants' dire cats, the giants begin to realize that they like it here. Not many folks around. Lots of big trees. Warmer than the moor. Nice place to live. The giants may hate orcs, but that doesn't make them nice giants, so the PCs need to dissuade them before they get too comfortable in their "new home."

Many ruins in Old Delzoun contained lost portals to the Underdark. Underdark denizens sometimes used these portals during surface raids.

In Silverymoon it is joked that Quaervarr is valuable in the alliance just to preserve its fine inn, the Whistling Stag.

Tavern tales told of a small coffer of coins once found behind a loose stone in the cellar wall. As a result of this persistent rumor, every part of the cellar was excavated multiple times by treasure seekers, but nothing was ever found. The Harpers rebuilt the cellar after each act of vandalism, which gave rise to another rumor about the cellar being haunted or magical.

## Common Themes & Conflicts
The Orcs vs. Everybody
 
The orcs in the North wage a constant war of raid and retreat on frontier out¬posts. Small wandering bands constantly harry farms and villages, stealing live¬stock and brutally killing people. Just as often, they take slaves. Attempts to nego¬tiate or control them for any length of time end in failure. Bounties placed on orcish heads only seem to encourage the beasts to attack for sport.
 
The Luskan/Ruathym War
 
The status of this conflict depends on when the DM begins the campaign. Dur¬ing the Year of the Prince, these two are waging bloodthirsty war upon on one another, with Ruathym getting the worst of it. Shiploads of Luskan raiders plunder and pillage the Ruathym coast and slay their leader.
 
During the Year of Shadows, Water- deep forces a truce and ends the conflict. In so doing, an alliance, the Captains' Con-federation, is forged between the Luskanites and the island kingdoms.
 
Con¬federation warriors raid cities along the Sword Coast in huge numbers and no ship at sea is safe from Northmen pirates. The Year of Shadows ends with the Lords of Waterdeep in council, deciding wheth¬er to declare war or not.
 
The Uthgardt Barbarians vs. Civi¬lization
 
The average Uthgardt regards civiliza¬tion as a cancer to be cut out. Most tribes regularly raid civilized settle¬ments, slaying domesticated animals, burning buildings, and crushing crops. Captives become slaves, though young¬sters are often adopted into the tribe if they seem sturdy enough.
 
The Uthgardt vs. the Orcs
 
This is a holy war. Its roots date back to the formation of the Uthgardt as a peo¬ple. The barbarians and the orcs com¬pete directly with one another for the same resources. Savage humans and bloodthirsty orcs fight to the death upon meeting. Adventurers in the North could do worse than to aid the Uthgardt in such a conflict.
 
Monsters vs. Humans
 
The monsters of the North, including the trolls of the Evermoors, treat humans — civilized and barbarian alike —as fruit ripe for the picking. There are always giants who raid villag¬es, foul creatures who wake hungry and leave their lairs to feast on a village, dragons who crave treasure, vampires with unholy thirsts, and more.
 
 
Pirates vs. Merchants
 
Piracy is an accepted fact of life in the northern Trackless Sea. Pirates attack ships along the Sword Coast from Ches (March) until Uktar (November). Most are Northmen, but about a third hail from southern lands.
 
Hellgate Keep vs. Mankind
The demonic forces of Hellgate Keep continually press against the human and dwarven folk in the northeast. Men have not been able to drive the demons out, but mercenary companies and adventuring bands can always find employ as guardians in Turnstone Pass. A monastery of Helm, near Neverwin- ter, sponsors a company of 100 troops of all character classes each year. This group, called Helm's Hundred, leaves Helm's Hold each spring for Sundabar.

#  Дикая местность

Всякий раз, когда персонажи покидают относитель¬ную безопасность Смертельных Снегов и путешествуют на большие расстояния, они подвергаются жестоким погодным условиям и опасным чудовищам диких мест. Смертельные Снега и земли на севере рассматриваются как открытая местность с целью определения случайной погоды (смотрите Главу 2), в то время как большинство других мест в городке и вокруг него считаются альпийскими областями.

С целью столкновений в дикой местности при¬нимайте Смертельные Снега и земли севернее как часть Лунных Земель, Долины Адбар и региона Холодной Долины (**Таблица 2)**. Очевидно, что любой идущий в горы, окружающие город, путешествует через Незерийские Горы (**Таблица 6**). Некоторые из случайных столкновений в дикой местности могут быть смертельными для партий среднего уровня. Шанс столкновения в течение каждого часа путешествия зависит от старания персонажей идти быстро или осторожно, смотрите Столкновения в дикой местности в Главе 2.

Никаких столкновений в дикой местности не происходит в пределах 2 миль от городских стен в тече¬ние дня или в пределах 1 мили - ночью или в плохую погоду. Даже чудища обходят городок стороной, если не ищут себе неприятностей.

#  Natural Hazards

Hungry monsters and rapacious brigands occupy the thoughts of many travelers in the North, but in truth these are not the deadliest dangers of this harsh land. Everyday oc￾currences such as a bitter cold snap in winter, an ill-timed snowfall, a forest fire, or a river in flood kill just as many travelers and homesteaders in the Silver Marches as mon￾sters do, and certainly have the potential to inflict much greater damage to property.

## AVALANCHES AND LANDSLIDES

The combination of high mountains and heavy snowfalls means that avalanches are a deadly peril in many areas around the North. The Lands Against the Wall, the Spine of the World, the Rauvin Mountains, and the passes through the Nether Mountains are particularly vulnerable. (Ironically, the Ice Mountains are not so dangerous, since they see less snowfall than their neighbors to the west.) If the snowpack is not high, death can still come hurtling down in the form of a landslide. The extremes of temperature common to the North fiercely weather the sides of mountains and cause many falling rocks throughout the year.

The effects of avalanches and landslides are described in The Environment in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide. The typical avalanche or landslide has a width of 1d6×100 feet, from one edge of the slide zone to the oppo￾site edge. The bury zone in the center of the avalanche is half as wide as the avalanche’s full width. To determine the pre￾cise location of characters in the path of an avalanche, roll 1d6×20; the result is the number of feet from the center of the path taken by the bury zone to the center of the party’s location. Avalanches advance at a speed of 500 feet per round, landslides at a speed of 250 feet per round.

## THE CLAWS OF THE COLD

Even in the summertime, the mountain passes and high slopes plummet below freezing at night. Most old hands in the Silver Marches own a good set of winter clothing, and are wise enough to stay out of the sort of weather winter clothing won’t help against.

For the effect of cold and extremely cold weather condi￾tions on characters and creatures, see Weather and Cold Dan￾gers, both in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide.

Cold Water: Characters who become soaked or drenched in cold water (usually by immersion in a mountain stream, but marching in a downpour can do the job) are much more vulnerable to cold damage. Moderate temperatures are treated as cold conditions and cold temperatures are treated as extremely cold conditions for purposes of determining whether a soaked character is vulnerable to cold damage.

This vulnerability remains for 2d4 hours or until a character changes into dry clothes. Soaked clothing provides no protec￾tion against cold damage.

Characters who remain immersed in cold water take 1d6 points of subdual damage per minute of exposure from hy￾pothermia.

Permafrost: North of the Sundabar Vale, permafrost con￾ditions prevail. Even in summer, the ground remains frozen hard a foot or so beneath the surface, except around sun￾warmed rocks. Buried corpses and food in contact with per￾mafrost will freeze (though stone cairns are necessary to keep scavengers away), and ready ice is always handy.

Frozen Lakes and Rivers: During winter, most bodies of water in the Silver Marches freeze over. Most years, the freeze comes in the month of Marpenoth, beginning 1d10+20 days into the month. The ice lasts until the month of Ches, disappearing 1d10+20 days into the month. The thickness of the ice depends on the month and whether or not the water is flowing:

| Month     | Standing Water | Flowing Water |
| --------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| Marpenoth | Thin           | —             |
|           |                |               |
| Uktar     | Moderate       | Thin          |
|           |                |               |
| Nightal   | Thick          | Moderate      |
|           |                |               |
| Hammer    | Thick          | Thick         |
|           |                |               |
| Alturiak  | Thick          | Thick         |
|           |                |               |
| Ches      | Thin           | Thin          |

Thin ice is 1 to 2 inches thick. It supports Small creatures. Medium-size creatures that run, jump, fall, or fight on the ice may cause a break (50% chance per round of such activity).

Moderate ice is 3 to 11 inches thick. It supports Large crea￾tures. Huge creatures that run, jump, fall, or fight on the ice may cause a break (50% chance per round of such activity).

Thick ice may be anywhere from 1 to 4 feet thick. It sup￾ports creatures of any size. Ice has 3 hit points per inch of thickness. If a creature too heavy for the ice causes a break, the ice collapses in a circle whose radius is 5 feet larger than the face (or dimensions) of the creature causing the break. Any creature caught in the fracture area except for the creature causing the break may attempt a Reflex save (DC 15) to reach safe ice before it gives way.

Thin ice is particularly dangerous, because the edges of a fractured area tend to crumble under a swimmer’s efforts to climb out. To climb out, a Small or Medium-size swimmer must succeed at an Escape Artist check (DC 15). Large crea￾tures can’t get back on top of thin ice after it fractures.

Frozen rivers are dangerous, too. Creatures who fall through the ice of a frozen river may be swept away from the hole by the current and trapped under the ice. Apply the drowning rule (see Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide) as necessary.  FOREST FIRES

Most campfire sparks ignite nothing, but if conditions are dry, winds are strong, or the forest floor is dried out and flammable, a forest fire can result. Lightning strikes often set trees afire and start forest fires in this way. Luckily, the lands of the Silver Marches are almost always damp. Small “scorch-smolders” of blackened vegetation are the usual result, not conflagrations that spread for miles. Yet travelers can get caught in fires. The leading edge of a fire (the downwind side) can advance faster than a human can run (assume 120 feet per round for winds of moderate strength). Once a particular portion of the forest is ablaze, it re￾mains so for 2d4×10 minutes before dying to a smolder. Within the bounds of a forest fire, a character faces three dangers: heat damage, catching on fire, and smoke inhalation.

Heat: Getting caught within a forest fire is even worse than being exposed to abysmal heat (see Heat Dangers in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide). Breathing the air causes a character to take 1d6 points of damage per round (no save). In addition, a character must make a Fortitude save every 5 rounds (DC 15, +1 per previous check) or sustain 1d4 points of subdual damage. A character who holds his breath can avoid the normal damage, but not the subdual damage.

Catching on Fire: Characters engulfed in a forest fire are at risk of catching on fire when the leading edge of the fire overtakes them, and are then at risk once per minute thereafter. See Catch￾ing on Fire in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide.

Smoke: Forest fires naturally produce a great deal of smoke. A character who breathes heavy smoke must make a Fortitude saving throw each round (DC 15, +1 per previous check) or spend that round choking and coughing. A charac￾ter who chokes for two consecutive rounds takes 1d6 points of subdual damage. Also, smoke obscures vision, giving one￾half concealment (20% miss chance) to characters within it.

## FLOODS

In locales throughout the Silver Marches where heavy pre￾cipitation and steep slopes prevail, floods are common.

Rivers in Flood: In spring, the enormous snowmelt from the slopes of the Nether and Rauvin mountains engorges most of the streams and rivers in and around the Silver Marches. During spring flood, rivers become wider, deeper, and swifter. Assume that a river rises by 1d10+10 feet during the spring flood, and its width increases by a factor of 1d4×50%. Fords may disappear for days, bridges may be swept away, and even ferries might not be able to manage the crossing of a flooded river.A river in flood adds +5 to the DC of any Swim checks that characters attempt. For example, Striding Giant Rapids on the Rauvin might normally be considered rough water (see the Swim skill description in Chapter 4 of the Player’s Hand￾book), which means that Swim checks to get across the river are against DC 15. When this area is in spring flood, the DC rises to 20. (The increase in water depth may make fords too deep for most travelers to wade successfully, so swimming may be their best option if crossing the river is necessary.)

Mountain Torrent: Innumerable swift, strong streams cascade down out of the mountains of the Silver Marches in all seasons. In general, the typical mountain torrent is 5d6 feet in width and studded with boulders. Waterfalls 1d6×10 feet in height occur every 1d4 miles. Unlucky or clumsy characters may find themselves in a fast-moving gauntlet of icy water, deadly rocks, and sudden waterfalls. Refer to Water Dangers in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide. Characters swept away by the torrent must attempt Swim checks (DC 15) every round to avoid going under. If a character gets a skill check result of 5 or more over the minimum necessary, he arrests his motion by catching a rock, tree limb, or bottom snag—he is no longer being carried along by the flow of the water. Escaping a torrent by reaching the bank requires three suc￾cessful Swim checks (DC 15) in a row. Characters arrested by a rock, limb, or snag can’t escape unless they strike out into the water and attempt to swim their way clear.

Flash Floods: These sudden, short-lived torrents occur after heavy rains or ice breakups in spring. A flash flood typically lasts only 4d4 minutes before the waters recede.  Flash floods advance at a speed of 60 feet. See Flash Floods under Weather Hazards in Chapter 3 of the DUN￾GEON MASTER’s Guide.  FOG

The forgotten peril of the North is its everpresent river mist and mountain fog. Characters traveling along a river by boat  can’t get too lost, of course. However, fogbound overland travel offers a real possibility of running into trees, gullies, and other hazards. A typical fog limits vision to a distance of 1d10×5 feet, completely foiling normal vision and darkvi￾sion beyond this range. Creatures closer than the absolute limit of visibility gain the benefits of one-half concealment (20% miss chance).  

##  Encountering Hazards

An encounter with a natural hazard in motion, such as an avalanche or a forest fire, begins in a particular way de￾pending on the type of hazard.

**Avalanche/Landslide:** An avalanche or landslide can be spotted from as far away as 1d10×500 feet by a character who makes a successful Spot check (DC 20). The DC of the Spot check is modified by any of the conditions that apply from Table 3–2 in the DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide. (Con￾sider the avalanche to be a Colossal encounter, meaning that the DC is immediately reduced by 16.) If all charac￾ters fail their Spot checks to determine the encounter dis￾tance, the avalanche moves closer to them, and they automatically become aware of it when it closes to half the original distance.

It’s possible to hear an avalanche coming even if you can’t see it. Under optimum conditions (no other loud noises occurring), a character who makes a successful Listen check (DC 15) can hear the avalanche or landslide when it is 1d6×500 feet away. This check might have a DC of 20, 25, or higher in conditions where hearing is difficult (such as in the middle of a thunderstorm).

**Forest Fire:** A forest fire can be spotted from as far away as 2d6×100 feet by a character who makes a success￾ful Spot check (DC 20). The DC of the Spot check is modi￾fied by any of the conditions that apply from Table 3–2 in the DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide. (Consider the fire to be a Colossal encounter, meaning that the DC is immediately reduced by 16.) If all characters fail their Spot checks to determine the encounter distance, the fire moves closer to them, and they automatically see it when it closes to half the original distance.Characters who are blinded or otherwise unable to make Spot checks can feel the heat of the fire (and thus auto￾matically “spot” it) when it is 100 feet away.

In general, the typical mountain torrent is 5d6 feet in width and studded with boulders. Waterfalls 1d6×10 feet in height occur every 1d4 miles. Unlucky or clumsy characters may find themselves in a fast-moving gauntlet of icy water, deadly rocks, and sudden waterfalls. Refer to Water Dangers in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide. Characters swept away by the torrent must attempt Swim checks (DC 15) every round to avoid going under. If a character gets a skill check result of 5 or more over the minimum necessary, he arrests his motion by catching a rock, tree limb, or bottom snag—he is no longer being carried along by the flow of the water. Escaping a torrent by reaching the bank requires three suc￾cessful Swim checks (DC 15) in a row. Characters arrested by a rock, limb, or snag can’t escape unless they strike out into the water and attempt to swim their way clear.

**Flash Floods:** These sudden, short-lived torrents occur after heavy rains or ice breakups in spring. A flash flood typically lasts only 4d4 minutes before the waters recede.  Flash floods advance at a speed of 60 feet. See Flash Floods under Weather Hazards in Chapter 3 of the DUN￾GEON MASTER’s Guide. 

## FOG

The forgotten peril of the North is its everpresent river mist and mountain fog. Characters traveling along a river by boat  can’t get too lost, of course. However, fogbound overland travel offers a real possibility of running into trees, gullies, and other hazards. A typical fog limits vision to a distance of 1d10×5 feet, completely foiling normal vision and darkvi￾sion beyond this range. Creatures closer than the absolute limit of visibility gain the benefits of one-half concealment (20% miss chance).

## Encountering Hazards

An encounter with a natural hazard in motion, such as an avalanche or a forest fire, begins in a particular way de￾pending on the type of hazard.

**Avalanche/Landslide:** An avalanche or landslide can be spotted from as far away as 1d10×500 feet by a character who makes a successful Spot check (DC 20). The DC of the Spot check is modified by any of the conditions that apply from Table 3–2 in the DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide. (Con￾sider the avalanche to be a Colossal encounter, meaning that the DC is immediately reduced by 16.) If all charac￾ters fail their Spot checks to determine the encounter dis￾tance, the avalanche moves closer to them, and they automatically become aware of it when it closes to half the original distance.

It’s possible to hear an avalanche coming even if you can’t see it. Under optimum conditions (no other loud noises occurring), a character who makes a successful Listen check (DC 15) can hear the avalanche or landslide when it is 1d6×500 feet away. This check might have a DC of 20, 25, or higher in conditions where hearing is difficult (such as in the middle of a thunderstorm).

**Forest Fire:** A forest fire can be spotted from as far away as 2d6×100 feet by a character who makes a success￾ful Spot check (DC 20). The DC of the Spot check is modi￾fied by any of the conditions that apply from Table 3–2 in the DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide. (Consider the fire to be a Colossal encounter, meaning that the DC is immediately reduced by 16.) If all characters fail their Spot checks to determine the encounter distance, the fire moves closer to them, and they automatically see it when it closes to half the original distance.Characters who are blinded or otherwise unable to make 

## Заблудились

There are many ways to get lost in the wilderness. Following an obvious road, trail, or feature such as a stream or lakeshore prevents any possibility of becoming lost, but trav￾elers striking off cross-country may become disoriented—es￾pecially in conditions of poor visibility or in difficult terrain.

**Poor Visibility:** Any time characters cannot see at least 60 feet in the prevail￾ing conditions of visibility, they may be￾come lost. Characters traveling through fog, snow, or a downpour might easily lose the ability to see any landmarks not in their immediate vicinity. Similarly, characters travel￾ing at night may be at risk, too, de￾pending on the quality of their light sources, the amount of moonlight, and whether or not they have dark￾vision or low-light vision.

**Difficult Terrain:** Any character in forest, moor, hill, or mountain terrain may become lost if he or she moves away from a trail, road, stream, or other obvious path or track.

**Chance to Get Lost:** If conditions exist that make getting lost a possibility, the character leading the way must succeed at a Wilderness Lore check or become lost. The difficulty of this check varies based on the terrain, the visibility condi￾tions, and whether or not the character has a map of the area being traveled through.

Check once per hour (or portion of an hour) spent in local or overland movement to see if travelers have become lost.

In the case of a party moving together, only the character leading the way makes the check. (DM Tip: Make this check in secret, since the characters may not realize that they’re lost right away.)

Effects of Being Lost: If a party becomes lost, it is no longer certain of moving in the direction it intended to travel.

Randomly determine the direction the party actually travels in during each hour of local or overland movement. The char￾acters’ movement continues to be random until they blunder into a landmark they can’t miss, or until they recognize that they are lost and make an effort to regain their bearings.

Recognizing that You’re Lost: Once per hour of random travel, each character in the party may attempt a Wilderness Lore check (DC 20 –1 per hour of random travel) to recognize that they are no longer certain of their direction of travel. Some circumstances may make it obvious that the characters are lost; if they expected to reach a certain spot within an hour but three or four hours pass by with no sign of their destination, that’s a bad sign.

Setting a New Course: A lost party is also uncertain of determin￾ing in which direction it should travel in order to reach a desired objective—even an objective such as “the point where we left the road and went off into these dratted woods.” Determining the correct direction of travel once a party has become lost re￾quires a Wilderness Lore check (DC 15 +2 per hour of random travel). If a character fails in this

check, he chooses a random direction as the “correct” direction for resuming travel. (DM Tip: Again, this is a check you should make in secret. The lost characters may think they know the way to travel after regaining their bearings, but could be entirely wrong again.) Once the characters are traveling along their new course, correct or incorrect, it’s entirely possible for them to get lost again. If the conditions still make it possible for travelers to become lost, check once per hour of travel as described under Chance to Get Lost to see if the party maintains its new course, or begins to move at random again.

Conflicting Directions: It’s possible that several characters may attempt to determine the right direction to proceed after becoming lost. That’s just fine. The DM makes a Wil￾derness Lore check for each character in secret, then tells the players whose characters succeeded the correct direction to travel, and tells the players whose characters failed a random direction they think is right. (DM Tip: A few extraneous die rolls behind your screen might make it less apparent which characters are right and which characters are wrong.)

Regaining Your Bearings: There are several ways to be￾come un-lost. First, if the characters successfully set a new course and follow it to the destination they’re trying to reach, they’re not lost anymore. Second, the characters through random movement might run into an unmistakable landmark. Third, if conditions suddenly improve—the fog lifts, the sun comes up, or the travelers use know direction to ascertain the correct direction of north—lost characters may attempt to set a new course, as described above, with a +4 bonus on the Wilderness Lore check. Finally, more powerful magic such as find the path may make their course clear.

## Путешествие по горам

High altitude can be extremely fatiguing—or sometimes deadly—to creatures that aren’t used to it. Cold becomes ex￾treme, and the lack of oxygen in the air can wear down even the most hardy of warriors.

Acclimated Characters: Creatures accustomed to high alti￾tude generally fare better than lowlanders. Any creature nor￾mally found in mountain terrain is considered native to the area, and acclimated to the high altitude. Characters with the Endurance feat, 4 ranks of Wilderness Lore, or 7 ranks of Climb are also acclimated to high altitude.

Undead, constructs, and other creatures that do not breathe are immune to altitude effects.

Altitude Bands: In general, mountains present three possi￾ble altitude bands: low pass, low peak/high pass, and high peak.

Low Pass (lower than 7,000 feet): Most travel in low mountains takes place in low passes. Travelers may find the going difficult (which is reflected in the movement modi￾fiers for traveling through mountains), but there are no un￾usual weather or altitude effects.

Low Peak or High Pass (7,000 to 20,000 feet): Ascending to the highest slopes of low mountains, or most normal travel through high mountains, falls into this category. At these ele￾vations, creatures may be subject to high altitude effects (see below). Temperatures at this level are one grade colder than the prevailing weather would indicate—for example, if the day’s temperature is moderate, it’s actually cold at this altitude.

High Peak (more than 20,000 feet): The highest slopes and peaks of high mountains exceed 20,000 feet in height. At these el￾evations, creatures may be subject to altitude sickness (see below).

Temperatures at this level are always two grades colder than the prevailing weather indicates—for example, if the day’s tempera￾ture is moderate, it’s actually extremely cold at this altitude.

High Altitude Effects: All nonacclimated creatures labor to breathe in the thin air at high altitude. See Lack of Air/High Altitude, under Other Dangers in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide. Acclimated characters are not subject to high altitude effects.

Altitude Sickness: Any creature at an altitude higher than 20,000 feet is subject to both high altitude effects and alti￾tude sickness, as described under Lack of Air/High Altitude in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide. Creatures acclimated to high altitude as described above receive a +4 bonus on their saving throws to resist high altitude effects and altitude sickness, but eventually even seasoned moun￾taineers must abandon these dangerous elevations.

## Зыбучие пески и топи

In moors, marshes, and other examples of sodden terrain, hidden, water-filled holes await the unwary. Obvious bogs are not very dangerous—everybody can recognize a mud￾hole or a scum-covered pond. However, some of these patches present a deceptively solid appearance and may trap careless characters. A character approaching a hidden bog or patch of quicksand at a normal pace is entitled to a Wilder￾ness Lore check (DC 8) to spot the danger before stepping in, but charging or running characters don’t have a chance to detect a hidden bog before blundering in. A typical patch of quicksand or quaking bog is (1d4+1)×5 feet in diameter; the momentum of a charging or running character carries him or her 1d2×5 feet into the bog.

Effects of Quicksand: Characters in quicksand must make a Swim check (DC 10) every round to simply tread water in place, or a Swim check (DC 15) to move 5 feet in whatever direction is desired. If a trapped character fails this check by 5 or more, he sinks below the surface and begins to drown whenever he can no longer hold his breath. Characters below the surface of a bog may swim back to the surface with a successful Swim check (DC 15 +1 per con￾secutive round of being under the surface).

Rescue: Pulling out a character trapped in quicksand can be difficult. A rescuer needs a branch, spear haft, rope, or similar tool that enables him to reach the victim with one end of it. Then he must make a Strength check (DC 15) to successfully pull the victim, and the victim must make a Strength check (DC 10) to hold onto the branch, pole, or rope. If the victim fails to hold on, he must make an imme￾diate Swim check (DC 15) to stay above the surface. If both checks succeed, the victim is pulled 5 feet closer to safety.

## RAIN, SNOW, SLEET, AND HAIL

Precipitation is a daily occurrence in the Silver Marches most of the year. Bad weather frequently slows or halts travel and makes it virtually impossible to navigate from one spot to another.

**Rain:** Rain is all too frequent in the North. Rain affects visibility, ranged attacks and Listen, Search, and Spot checks as described in Precipitation under Weather Hazards in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide. Characters caught out in steady rain become soaked in 2d6×10 minutes, which may make them more vulnerable to cold damage (see The Claws of the Cold earlier in this chapter).

**Downpours:** These sudden, heavy rains often cause flash floods in hilly or mountainous country. Downpours have all the properties of rain, except that visibility is reduced as de￾scribed below, and characters become soaked in 10 minutes, rendering them more susceptible to cold damage.

Visibility in a downpour is limited to a range of 1d10×5 feet. Creatures closer than the absolute limit of visibility gain one-half concealment (20% miss chance).

**Hail:** The effects of hail are described in Precipitation under Weather Hazards in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide. Hail in the North can be unusually heavy and dangerous—there is a 10% chance that the hail deals 1 point of damage to all creatures caught in the open, and if this happens, there’s a 20% chance that hailstones the size of a human fist (or bigger) fall. This extra-large hail deals 1d4 points of damage to any creature caught in the open. Fallen hail reduces movement by half, just like a fall of snow. In moderate or warm temperatures, it takes 1d4 hours for fallen hail to melt. In cold temperatures, hail remains on the ground for 4d4 hours.

**Sleet:** The ice storms of the North are legendary for their destructive power. Sleet has the same effects on visibility, ranged attacks, and Listen, Search, and Spot checks as rain, and reduces movement by half.

Sleet hisses as it falls, and coats everything with ice, creat￾ing slippery conditions for any skill checks affected by the conditions of the surface (Balance and Climb, for example). This slippery state lasts until snowfall covers the ice, or a thaw (one day of moderate or higher temperatures) melts it. In addition, sleet soaks characters in the open over the course of 2d6×10 minutes, making them more vulnerable to cold damage.

**Snow:** Falling snow has the same effects on visibility, ranged weapon attacks, and skill checks as rain, and reduces movement to half. A day of snowfall leaves 1d6 inches of snow on the ground. When the depth of the snow reaches half a creature’s height, movement is slowed to one-quarter normal, and when snow reaches a creature’s height, move￾ment is halved again.

Snow melts off at the rate of 4 inches per day of moder￾ate temperatures, 8 inches per day of warm temperatures, or 12 inches per day of hot temperatures.

**Heavy Snow:** Heavy snowfall has the same effects as normal snowfall, but also restricts visibility as fog does (see Fog, earlier in this section). A day of heavy snow leaves 1d3 feet of snow on the ground. Heavy snow accompanied by strong or severe winds may result in snowdrifts 1d4×5 feet in depth, especially in and around objects big enough to de￾flect the prevailing wind—a cabin or large tent, for instance. There is a 10% chance that a heavy snowfall is accompa￾nied by lightning (see below).

## LIGHTNING

Thunderstorms are common in the summer and early fall in the Silver Marches. A mountain thunderstorm is nothing to stand around and admire; it can be deadly. Lightning some￾times accompanies heavy snowfalls, too.

**Thunderstorms:** During a day in which thunderstorms appear, creatures in the open encounter 1d3 distinct storms. Each storm lasts for 2d6×10 minutes. There is a 20% chance per storm that a bolt endangers a creature or group of creatures in the open. Each lightning bolt inflicts 1d10 8-sided dice of damage in a 10-foot radius. Roll randomly to determine which char￾acter is at the center of the strike. Any threatened character (including the character at the center) is entitled to a Reflex save (DC 15) to take only half damage.

## SANDSTORMS

Thanks to the dampness of the North, duststorms are un￾known in these lands, but sandstorms—heavy particles driven by furious winds from Anauroch—occur from time to time.

They seldom reach west of Sundabar. Sandstorms reduce vis￾ibility to 1d10×5 feet and provide a –4 penalty on Listen, Search, and Spot checks. Sandstorms deal 1d3 points of subdual damage per hour to any creatures caught in the open, and leave a thin coating of sand (1d2 inches) in their wake.

**Avalanche/Landslide:** A natural hazard threatens the characters; see the Encountering Natural Hazards sidebar and Avalanches and Landslides, later in this chapter. Refer also to Landslides and Avalanches in Chapter 3 of the DUN￾GEON MASTER’s Guide.

**Arctic Dwarf Hunters:** The hunting party consists of 1d4+2 arctic dwarf War1, 1d2 arctic dwarf  arbarians (level 1d3+2), and a leader of level 1d4+3. To determine the leader’s class, roll d%: 01–50, barbarian; 51–65, cleric; 66–75, druid; 76–80, fighter; 81–95, ranger; 96–100, rogue.

**Bandits:** 1d6+1 1st-level warriors and 1d2 NPC leaders of level 1d3+1. To determine the class of the leaders, roll d%: 01–15, cleric; 16–40, fighter; 41–60, rogue; 61–70, sorcerer; 71–100, warrior. Bandits are usually chaotic evil. For the race of the bandit group, roll d%: 01–10, dwarf; 11–70, human; 71–100, half-orc.

**Bugbear Band:** 1d10+10 bugbears, 1d3 bugbear warriors (level 1d3+1), and 1 bugbear fighter (level 1d4+3).

**Dwarf Patrol:** 1d4+4 1st-level shield dwarf warriors, 1d2 shield dwarf clerics (level 1d3), and 1 leader (level 1d4+2).For the leader’s class, roll d%: 01–15, barbarian; 16–35, cleric; 36–85, fighter; 86–90, paladin; 91–95, rogue; 96–100, wizard.

**Forest Fire:** In summer or fall, a forest fire endangers the characters. The fire covers a front 3d10×500 feet across, centered on the location of the party at the time the encounter was generated. See the Encountering Natural Hazards sidebar and Forest Fires, later in this chapter. In winter or spring, treat this as no encounter.

**Ghast Pack:** 1d3+1 ghasts and 1d6+1 ghouls.

**Ghost:**This encounter consists of 1d4 ghosts of level 1d4+2. To determine the class of each ghost, roll d%: 01–05,bard; 06–20, cleric; 21–60, fighter; 61–65, ranger; 66–80, rogue; 81–90, sorcerer; 91–100, wizard. The ghosts are usu￾ally neutral evil. For the race of the ghosts, roll d%: 01–25, shield dwarf; 26–40, moon elf; 41–80, human; 81–90, half￾orc; 91–100, lightfoot halfling.

**Gnoll Hunters:** 1d4+2 gnolls, led by 1 gnoll ranger (level 1d3+2) and 1 gnoll adept (level 1d4) and accompanied by  1d2 dire wolves.

**Goblin Raiders:** 1d4+4 goblins, led by 1 goblin fighter (level 1d4+1) and 1 goblin adept (level 1d4). All the goblins are mounted on worgs.

**Merchants:** 2d4 1st-level commoners, 2d4 1st-level war￾riors, and 1d2 NPC leaders (level 1d4+1). To determine the leaders’ classes, roll d%: 01–10, cleric; 11–35, fighter; 36–55, rogue; 56–60, wizard; 61–75, warrior; 76–100, expert. Merchants match the normal alignment for their race (neutral if alignment is not specified). For the race of the merchants, roll d%: 01–20, shield dwarf; 21–25, moon elf; 26–75, human; 76–85, lightfoot halfling; 86–95, half￾orc; 96–100, rock gnome.

**Mountain Torrent:** The party encounters an unmarked stream in its path with no obvious means of crossing. There is a 50% chance that some kind of precarious crossing exists (a fallen log, or chain of boulders) that can be employed with a successful Balance check (DC 15). Failure on this check means that the character falls in the water and may be swept downstream; see Mountain Torrents under Floods in the following section. If the party is traveling along a road or trail, the stream is bridged in some fashion. Treat this as no encounter.

**NPCs:** The NPC party consists of 1d3+2 individuals (level 2d4). To determine the alignment, race, and class of each character, consult Tables 2–28 through 2–32 in the DUN￾GEON MASTER’s Guide, or use the corresponding tables in the FORGOTTEN REALMS DUNGEON MASTER’s Screen.

**Orc Marauders:** 1d10+5 orcs, 1d3+1 orc barbarians (level 1d3+1), and 1 orc adept (level 1d6) accompanied by 1d2 dire boars.

**Orc Warband:** 1d10+10 orcs, 1d3 orc barbarians (level 1d3+1), 1d3 orc fighters (level 1d3+1), 1 orc adept (level 1d6), and 1 orc leader (level 1d3+3), accompanied by 1d2 dire boars. To determine the leader’s class, roll d%: 01–30, barbarian; 31–45, cleric; 46–80, fighter; 81–85, ranger; 86–90, rogue; 91–100, sorcerer.

**Uthgardt Scouts:** 1d4+2 1st-level human warriors and 1d2 leaders (level 1d6+1). For the leaders’ classes, roll d%: 01–50, barbarian; 51–65, cleric; 66–75, druid; 76–85, ranger; 86–90, rogue; 91–100, sorcerer. There is a 30% chance the group belongs to the Sky Pony tribe and is mounted. Uthgardt scouts are usually chaotic neutral.

**Vampire Troupe:** 1d2 vampires and 1d4+1 vampire spawn.

**Werewolf Raiders:** 1d4+1 werewolves, 1d4+4 wolves, and 1 werewolf leader (level 1d6+1). To determine the leader’s class, roll d%: 01–15, cleric; 16–25, druid; 26–60, fighter;61–75, ranger; 76–90, rogue; 91–100, sorcerer.

**Wood Elf Patrol:** 1d4+4 1st-level wood elf warriors, 1d2 wood elf rogues (level 1d3+1), 1d2 wood elf sorcerers (level 1d3+1), and 1 leader (level 1d4+3).

# Random Weather

Many different weather influences impact the Silver Marches.

The prevailing weather patterns in this part of Faerûn tend to come from the Sea of Swords to the west, and the presence of high mountains on all sides often creates “cloud barriers” that force frequent precipitation. The presence of Anauroch nearby also influences the weather in unpredictable ways. Any particular day’s weather consists of three components: the temperature, the wind strength, and the precipitation.

Tables 8 through 11 provide random weather combina￾tions based on each season, weighted toward more or less likely results. A sudden thaw in the mountains is possible in winter, but it’s not as likely as long stretches of bitter cold or heavy snow.

## USING THE TABLES

Any given weather condition lasts for 1d6 days before a new pattern sets in, so it’s only necessary to roll for new weather when the previous pattern ends, not every day. The weather tables are organized into three basic locations: river valleys, open country, and northern or alpine areas. Apply the same die roll to all three regions (this makes it less likely that the mountains will be experiencing a rare thaw at the same time the river valleys are suffering from a brutal cold snap).

**River Valley:** The Rauvin and Sundabar vales fall into this category, as well as the eaves of the High Forest. Although plagued by heavy fogs throughout the year, these regions are more sheltered than other parts of the Silver Marches.

**Open Country:** The Evermoors, Moonlands, Old Delzoun (except for Sundabar Vale), and the forests of the northern Silver Marches fall into this category.

**Northern or Alpine Regions:** The Ice, Nether, and Rauvin mountains fall into this category, as well as other lands that are hard against the Spine of the World, such as the Druar￾wood and the Lands Against the Wall.

## DEFINITIONS

Results from Tables 8 through 11 are described below.

Temp.: Temperature results fall into the following broad categories. Nighttime temperatures are generally 10 to 20 degrees colder and may actually fall into the next colder cat￾egory (50% chance).

Hot: Between 86° and 110° F.

Warm: Temperatures between 61° and 85° F.

Moderate: Temperatures from 41° to 60° F.

Cold: Temperatures between 0° and 40° F.

Extreme Cold: Temperatures below 0° F.

Wind: The strength of the prevailing wind. Periods of calm or sudden stronger gusts are possible. Wind strength de￾creases one category at night (severe to strong, for example).

The three results on the Random Weather tables are fair, varies, and storm. Consult Table 12.

TABLE 12: WIND STRENGTH

| Fair   | Varies | Storm  | Strength       |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | -------------- |
| 01–70  | 01–40  | —      | Light/moderate |
| 71–95  | 41–70  | 01–10  | Strong         |

Wind effects are summarized on Table 3–17 in the DUN￾GEON MASTER’s Guide.

Precip.: The type of precipitation that falls during the day. A solid day of rain is pretty rare—even during heavy bliz￾zards, clear spells hours long may appear.

Clear: No precipitation of note.

Downpour: 1d3 downpours lasting 1d4 hours each occur during the day. Otherwise, the day consists of rain.

Fog: There is a 75% chance that the fog burns off during the af￾ternoon, resulting in 1d4+2 hours of clear weather before sunset.

Hail: 1d3 hailstorms lasting 1d6×10 minutes each occur during the day. Otherwise the day consists of rain.

Heavy Snow: Heavy snow falls throughout the day, although 1d3–1 clear spells lasting 1d4 hours each break up the day.

Rain: Rain falls consistently throughout the day, although 1d4–1 clear spells lasting 1d4 hours each break up the day.

Sandstorm: Sandstorm conditions persist throughout the day, punctuated by 1d4–2 breaks lasting 1d4 hours each.

Snow: Snow falls steadily, but 1d4–1 clear breaks of 1d4 hours each interrupt the snowfall.

Sleet: Sleet falls for most of the day, broken by 1d4–2 breaks lasting 1d4 hours each.

Thunderstorm: 1d3 thunderstorms lasting 2d6×10 min￾utes each occur during the day. Otherwise the day is clear (50% chance) or rainy (50% chance).

# Bestiary changes

# Измерение времени - About time measurement

Gary Gygax said “YOU CANNOT HAVE A MEANINGFUL CAMPAIGN IF STRICT TIME RECORDS ARE NOT KEPT.“
 
I almost didn’t post this for fear of it being misused. Please don’t simply look up the parties travel pace below, determine what was found, mark off the time and move on. This is a role playing game after all. The following is intended as an aid in Dungeon Mastering a game, not as a substitute for it.
 
Time in a dungeon is measured in minutes – switching to 6 second rounds when there is an encounter.
 
The following is my interpretation of the official rules and a few of my house rules mixed in, presented here as advice to Dungeon Masters. Where I refer to “you”, I mean the DM. This is specifically for a dungeon crawls, but most of it applies to all similar situations. This is intended as a guide for tracking time passage in a dungeon and also for a guide in deciding when to use a character’s passive perception score or to roll a perception check.
 
The Dungeon Master describes what the PCs can see, hear, etc. Most of the time you can expect that the PCs are being observant so if they could notice something, they will notice it. So don’t wait for a player to say his character is examining the floor, or looking for footprints to tell them that there’s an obvious set of footprints on the floor in front of him. Players can ask questions or tell you what their PCs are going to do (or attempt to do). Players should never have to refer to skill names to do this. You decide if they need to roll an ability or skill check and which one. To keep the game moving at a reasonable pace, I recommend that you keep the die rolling to a minimum. If a player’s character would most likely notice something or recognize something or understand something based on his abilities and background, no roll is required. Just tell him.
 
The DM will roll all of the PCs search checks in secret and tell the players what, if anything, their characters found. That way, if they don’t find anything, they won’t know if there wasn’t anything there or if there was something and they didn’t find it. Another advantage of rolling behind your DM screen is that you can ignore the roll when necessary. If you want them to find something (or not find it), ignore the roll and tell them what they found (or that they didn’t find anything).
 
***Ask them for their marching order, but don’t ask if they are moving at a “fast pace”, “normal pace” or “slow pace”. That makes it sound too much like a computer game. Instead, simply ask them what they are doing. Use their answer to determine their pace and use that to help you determine how long it will take and what they do or do not notice.***
 
In addition to the fast pace, normal pace and slow pace listed in the Player’s Handbook, I have added a “very fast” pace and an ”extremely slow” pace.
 
Overview:
 
1. Moving at a very fast pace they automatically fail all perception checks. If they say “We are getting out of here as fast as we can” they are obviously not going to take the time to check for traps or secret doors so they are moving at a very fast pace (600 feet per minute).
 
2. Moving at a fast pace uses their passive perception scores with a -5 penalty. If they say “We are going to move through here as quickly as we can and still be on the lookout for traps”, you can say to yourself that that sounds like a fast pace (400 feet per minute).
 
3. Moving at a normal pace uses their passive perception scores. If they don’t give you any indication of how fast or cautiously they are moving through corridors, assume that they are moving at this pace. If they say “We are going to be watching for hidden monsters and checking for traps and secret doors as we proceed cautiously down the corridor”, you know that, even though this sounds like it might be a slow pace it is actually the normal way adventurers would explore a dungeon so it is a normal pace (300 feet per minute).
 
4. Moving at a slow pace they can be stealthy or search for things. If they don’t give you any indication of how fast they are searching a room, assume that they are moving at this pace. They make a Dexterity (Stealth) check if they are hiding or being stealthy. Make a Wisdom (Perception) check for them if they are searching for secret doors or traps. If not actively searching, they use their passive perception scores. If they say “We are trying not to be noticed as we proceed cautiously down the corridor” they are being stealthy and can only move at a slow pace (200 feet per minute).
 
5. Moving at an extremely slowly pace they will automatically find anything that can be found. If they say “We know there must be a secret door in this corridor, so we are going to search until we find it”, you know that they are going to keep looking until they find it if they can, so they are traveling at a extremely slow pace (30 feet per minute).
 
The times listed below are the suggested minimum times required. Additional time may be required depending on circumstances and PC actions. Anything found (secret doors, traps, treasures, and especially monsters) will add to the listed times below as they take the time to deal with what they have found.
 
* If they find a secret door they may then attempt to find a means to open it.
 
* I might have the searcher make an Intelligence (Investigation) check and subtract the results form 20 minutes for low long it takes. I will never let them find a secret door and never find out how to open it!
 
* If they find a trap they may then attempt to disarm or avoid it.
 
* It takes 5 minutes to disarm traps or pick a lock if proficient with thieves tools; 10 minutes otherwise. This assumes fairly straightforward mechanisms, not complex puzzles
 
* If they find a treasure they may then check it for traps.
 
 
Details:
 
Traversing corridors, stairs, and other passageways:
 
•When moving at a very fast pace (600 feet per minute), all attempts to notice any secret doors, hidden monsters or traps will fail. This speed is equivalent to the Dash action.
 
•When moving at a fast pace (400 feet per minute), passive Wisdom (Perception) scores, with a -5 penalty, will be used to see if they notice any secret doors, hidden monsters or traps.
 
•When moving at a normal pace (300 feet per minute), passive Wisdom (Perception) scores will be used to see if they notice any secret doors, hidden monsters or traps.
 
•When moving at a slow pace (200 feet per minute), the characters can attempt to hide or be stealthy. If hiding, Dexterity (Stealth) checks will be used against the Wisdom (Perception) checks of any monsters that are actively searching for them, and against the passive Wisdom (Perception) scores of any monsters that aren’t searching. Moving at this pace they can actively search for hidden doors or traps. Roll a Wisdom (Perception) check for the searchers and let them know if they found anything in this 200 foot length of corridor. Let the single roll be for detecting hidden doors and/or traps regardless of what they say they are searching for. Note that if they say they are being stealthy, but don’t express an interest in watching out for traps or finding secret doors, only roll Dexterity (Stealth) checks and use passive Wisdom (Perception) scores. Conversely, if they say that they are looking for traps, or secret doors but don’t seem interested in being stealthy, roll Wisdom (Perception) checks only.
 
•If the party intends to take as much time as required to thoroughly search a section of corridor, the party will be moving at an extremely slowly pace (30 feet per minute). This represents that the character is being extremely cautious and diligent in his searching. At this pace that character will automatically succeed at finding any secret doors, hidden monsters or traps that can be found by that character. [The DMG says “In some cases, a character is free to [retry a failed ability check]; the only real cost is the time it takes[…] To speed things up, assume that a character spending ten times the normal amount of time needed to complete a task automatically succeeds at that task.” This is the 5e equivalent to the 3.5e “Taking 20” rule.]
 
* One character can search the walls, floor and ceiling of a 5 foot wide passage, or one side of a wider passage out to 5 feet from the wall.
 
* 2 characters can cover a 10 foot wide passage.
 
* Characters that are searching can perform no other activities.
 
* Characters that are not searching can be on the lookout for monsters. For large parties they may need one lookout near the front and another one in the rear. If a monster approaches the group from a direction that is being watched, the Dexterity (Stealth) check of that character will be used against the Wisdom (Perception) checks of any monsters that are actively searching for them, and against the passive Wisdom (Perception) scores of any monsters that aren’t searching.
 
### Searching a Room:
 
If the party opens a door but doesn’t enter a room and only observes it from the doorway it doesn’t take any additional time to be able to map its location and general notes about it, but not its exact size or anything about the room that cannot be quickly seen. A detailed description will require that the party enters the room.
 
After they enter the room, describe what they see and ask what each character is doing. Describe the results of their activities. If they say “I am searching the room”. Don’t ask “What are you searching for?” rather say something like “What does searching the room look like? Describe exactly what your character is doing.” If they say “I am looking for secret doors.” Don’t ask which 5 foot section of wall he is searching, rather assume he will search all of the walls and use the travel paces descried below to determine his success or failure. If it makes a difference, or if you simply want him to think it might, you could ask where he is starting his search and which direction he will be searching from there. A room can be memorable and fun if you can get them to describe how they are interacting with the objects in the room.
 
The party may have a different travel pace for rooms than it does for corridors. Their pace may change in a room if they discover something interesting (or dangerous) but I wouldn’t normally mark off more than 10 minutes per room unless they slow to an extremely slow pace. Your players should be able to search as much as they want. Just warn them of the consequences (time passing, wandering monsters, etc.) ahead of time.
 
How pace of travel effects checking out rooms:
 
•Very fast pace (600 feet per minute – measured from entrance to exit by the shortest path). Treat these rooms like corridors. They are almost running through the rooms and won’t notice anything much more than their size and location. They automatically fail all perception checks. They will be surprised by any monsters waiting for them. They may surprise monsters that aren’t expecting them.
 
•Fast pace (1 minute per room). They are mostly just passing through. They can note what is in the room, its size, number and location of its exits. The Passive Wisdom (Perception) scores of the searchers, with a -5 penalty, will be used to see if they notice any secret doors, hidden monsters or traps. They are moving through the room too fast to search for any hidden treasure but will notice things that are in plain sight.
 
•Normal pace (5 minutes per room). Use this pace if they want to search the room but want to be quick about it. The passive Wisdom (Perception) scores of the searchers will be used to see if they notice any secret doors, hidden monsters or traps. At this pace they can make a quick search for hidden treasure at a disadvantage using their Wisdom (Perception) scores.
 
•Slow pace (10 minutes per room). Use this pace if they don’t give you any other indication of how fast they are searching a room. Use this pace if they want to loot the room, or if they want to be stealthy. Roll the Wisdom (Perception) checks of the searchers to see if they notice any secret doors, hidden monsters, hidden treasure or traps. If they are being stealthy, their Dexterity (Stealth) checks will be used against the Wisdom (Perception) checks of any monsters that are in the room or that enter the room and that are watching for them, and against the passive Wisdom (Perception) scores of any monsters that aren’t.
 
•Extremely slowly pace (1 hour per room). At this pace they can carefully examine every inch of the room. At this pace they will automatically succeed at finding any secret doors, hidden monsters, hidden treasure or traps that can be found by their characters. If there is something in the room that they wouldn’t be able to find even if they rolled a 20 on an ability check and added all of their bonuses, it is beyond their ability to find so it will remain hidden.
 
•The times above represent at least 2 characters searching.
 
•Two characters can search the walls, floor and ceiling and everything inside of a room up to 30’ x 30’. Larger rooms, or rooms with a large amount of “stuff” may take longer. Rooms smaller than 30’ x 30’ still take the indicated time to search.
 
•A single character searching the same room will take twice as long.
 
•More than two characters searching the room do not reduce the time any further unless it is a very large room.
 
•Characters that are searching can perform no other activities.
 
•Characters that are not searching can be on the lookout for monsters. One character can watch only one entrance without penalty. If a monster approaches the group through an entrance that is being watched, the Dexterity (Stealth) check of that character will be used against the Wisdom (Perception) checks of any monsters that are actively searching for you, and against the passive Wisdom (Perception) scores of any monsters that aren’t searching.

# Wilderness Adventuring

Sometimes in a D&D adventure, travel through the wilderness is purely a matter of description. Players describe where their characters are headed, and you narrate what happens on the way. At other times, the journey is as important to the adventure as its destination, and wilderness exploration rules will come into play.

This section provides a turn-based system for traveling outdoors. The rules address how to move through and investigate a wilderness area, and they discuss environmental considerations such as weather and high altitude.

An optional section has rules that cover tasks characters can undertake while exploring in the outdoors, and how those tasks are performed, plus a system for determining what happens if the characters get lost in the wilderness.

Your Outdoor Map

Before the characters can explore a wilderness or other outdoor area, you need to have a map that outlines its key geographic features and terrain.

The outdoor environment you’re mapping might be an expanse of wilderness on the surface of the world or a vast subterranean location, such as the great caverns and passages of the Underdark. Either way, it’s better to use a hex grid than a square grid for mapping, because a hex grid enables more precise calculation of the distance between two points.

The scale of your outdoor map depends on how much detail you want. For the most detailed areas, each hex or square represents 1 mile. To cover larger areas, each hex or square represents 6 miles. Your largest scale maps, those covering massive areas, should cover 36 miles per hex or square.

Just as you would do in a dungeon, track the characters’ movement on your outdoor map to determine what sort of terrain they encounter, monster lairs, settlements, or other noteworthy features they might stumble across. To keep things simple, assume that the characters find a noteworthy location when they enter its hex or square, unless the site is specifically hidden. The characters might not walk directly up to the front door of a ruined castle in the 1-mile-wide hex they just entered, but they can find old paths, outlying ruins, and such signs of its presence in the area with ease.

Visibility. When traveling outdoors, characters can see about 2 miles in any direction on a clear day, assuming that trees, hills, and other obstructions don’t block their view. Rain cuts visibility down to 1 mile, and fog cuts it down to a few hundred feet.
Multiply the distance the characters can see by 20 if they are atop a mountain or a tall hill, or are otherwise able to look down upon the area around them from a lofty height.

Terrain

Outdoor terrain is represented by a few general categories that describe how difficult it is to travel through an area of that terrain and (in the optional rules] find food and water.

For the purpose of travel, terrain is either normal or difficult, with difficult terrain cutting the characters’ speed in half while they travel through it

If the characters travel by a road or path, they move at their normal speed regardless of the terrain around them.

TERRAIN SUMMARY | Type	Travel

Desert	| Normal
Forest	| Difficult
Hills	| Normal
Jungle	| Difficult
Mountains	| Difficult
Plains	| Normal
Road/Path	| Normal
Swamp	| Difficult
Tundra	| Normal

## The Wilderness Turn

This is the sequence of play for an hour of travel and exploration in a wilderness environment.

1.	Direction and Pace. The players decide what direction their characters will move in and their travel pace. The players should also determine their formation: who is in the front, the middle, and the back of the group. (If you’re using the optional rules, they also decide on their exploration tasks at this time.]

2.	Progress on the Map. Determine the distance and the direction the characters traveled, taking into account their travel pace and chosen path.

3.	Random Encounters. Check for a random encounter and, if one is indicated, resolve any interaction or combat that occurs between the creatures and the characters.

4.	Environmental Effects. Apply effects of the environment, weather, or terrain, such as extreme cold. Some of these effects might require saving throws from the characters. In addition, if the characters attempt a forced march, resolve saving throws for that activity at this point.

If exploration continues, go back to the first step and repeat the sequence for another turn.

## Travel Pace

The travel pace that the characters choose—fast, moderate, or slow—determines the chance that monsters and other threats surprise them, how much distance they can cover during an hour of movement, and (in the optional rules] what tasks they can perform as they travel.

Explain to the players what their choices are. Do they want to get through the next area quickly, without much care for possible dangers, or are they determined to move slowly and keep a close watch for anything along their path? When the group decides on a travel pace, use the line on the Travel Pace table that corresponds to their intent. If the party splits up, each smaller group chooses its own pace.

The travel pace of an exploring group determines its readiness. This quality is expressed as a DC that you can use for several circumstances, such as when a character makes a Wisdom saving throw at the start of a battle to avoid being surprised or (in the optional rules] when the characters are in danger of becoming lost.

Travel pace also determines the greatest distance a group can cover during an hour, as shown on the table. Difficult terrain, including forests, mountains, jungles, and swamps reduces travel speed by half. For example, a group moving at a moderate pace through a forest can expect to traverse no more than 1 mile every hour.

## Random Encounters

You check at the end of each hour to see whether someone or something inadvertently crosses the adventurers’ path, or vice versa.
The population density of the region determines the likelihood of coming across monsters (see the table]. To check for wandering monsters, roll a d20. If an encounter occurs, roll on the appropriate wandering monster table to determine what the heroes meet. (This table might be one of your devising, or it might be provided inside the adventure you’re running.]

Note that the nature of random encounters depends on the region the characters are exploring. On a civilized road, they are more likely to encounter a wandering tinker or a caravan than a band of monsters.
 
Region | Encounter Chance (d20)

Sparsely inhabited | 20

Densely inhabited | 18-20

Typical region  | 18-20

## Encountering Creatures

If an exploring group encounters creatures (which might be wandering monsters or might be specific participants in the adventure], the characters can try to attack them, avoid them, or interact with them in some other way.

Alertness	| Readiness DC

Low	| 20

Normal	| 10

High	| 5

## Encounter Distance

Typically, the terrain or layout of an area determines how far the characters are from creatures when the groups become aware of each other. If this distance isn’t predetermined, roll a d20 + 20. Multiply that result by 10 if the area is in normal terrain (such as a grassy field, barren tundra, or a frozen lake] or by 5 if the terrain is difficult (such as rolling hills, or a forest]. The resulting number is the distance in feet between the two groups at the start of their encounter.

### Stealth

Before asking the players what they want to do, determine if either group notices the other. One group or the other can avoid detection completely only if all its members are sneaking. Otherwise, contests occur as necessary to determine if anyone sneaking on either side is detected.

### Surprise

If one group is hidden from the other, that group has surprise, as described in the combat rules. Otherwise, each creature and character makes a Wisdom saving throw against a DC that corresponds to its readiness. The readiness DC for characters is determined by their travel pace. For monsters, it depends on their degree of alertness, as shown below.

TRAVEL PACE | Pace	Readiness DC

Fast	| 15

Moderate | 10 

Slow	| 5

## Finding Locations and Objects

When the characters come across a location or an object of special note during the performance of their tasks, describe the discovery to them and allow them to take actions as appropriate.

# Weather

In addition to the risk of encountering creatures or stumbling across a strange location, the characters also face mundane weather threats such as heavy rain, freezing cold, or searing heat.

You can pick weather to fit your campaign or roll on the following tables to determine the weather for a given day. Use the table that corresponds to the current season of the year (assuming the region has a temperate climate]. The tables include one for each of the four seasons found in temperate regions, plus two more for exceptionally hot and cold environments such as desert and tundra. You can also use these tables to account for the geography or altitude of a region or area. For instance, the upper heights of a mountain range will be cold and snowy even in a warm climate.

**Temperate Spring/Fall**

No special weather | Storm (light rain) | Storm (heavy rain)

Temperate | Winter	Weather (d20)

Cold	| 1-14

Cold, storm (snow)	| 18-20

Cold, storm (heavy snow) | 16-20

**Temperate Summer**

No special weather Hot

Storm (heavy rain)

Desert

Hot

Hot, storm (dust)

Storm (heavy rain)

Tundra

Cold, storm (snow)

Cold, storm (heavy snow)

## Cold Weather

While the temperature is below 0 degrees Fahrenheit, characters exposed to the cold must make DC 10 Constitution saves at the end of each hour. Characters without cold weather gear, such as thick coats, gloves, and so on, automatically fail this save.

On a failed saving throw, a character gains a level of exhaustion.

## Storm

Bad weather, such as snow, rain, powerful winds, dust storms, and other hazards, reduces travel speeds by half, quartering speed in total when combined with difficult terrain.

In addition, specific types of storms have the following additional effects.

**Dust Storm**. Visibility is reduced to 50 feet, and creatures suffer disadvantage on saves to avoid becoming surprised.

**Heavy Rain**. Visibility is reduced to 50 feet, and creatures suffer disadvantage on saves to avoid becoming surprised.

**Heavy Snow**. Visibility is reduced to 50 feet, and creatures suffer disadvantage on saves to avoid becoming surprised. Heavy snow continues to reduce speed as described above for 1d6 days after the storm.

## Hot Weather

In exceptionally hot weather (at or above 100 degrees Fahrenheit], characters exposed to the heat must make DC 10 Constitution saves at the end of each hour. Characters wearing medium or heavy armor or otherwise clad in heavy clothing suffer disadvantage on this save.
On a failed saving throw, a character gains a level of exhaustion.

## High Altitude

Traveling at altitudes above 10,000 feet is particularly taxing due to the lack of oxygen in the air. Each hour spent traveling counts as two hours for purposes of determining how long characters can travel.

Exhausted characters cannot rest to reduce their exhaustion while above 10,000 feet.

Characters and creature can become acclimated to high altitude. Doing so requires spending many months at this elevation. Creatures cannot become acclimated to elevations above 20,000 feet. 

Creatures that do not need to breathe, such as undead creatures or constructs, suffer no ill effects from high altitude.

## Food and Water

In the wilderness, carrying enough food and water to survive is critical to survival. Characters who run short of either suffer the effects of exhaustion.

### Water

A character consumes one gallon of water per day, or two gallons each day if the weather is hot. A character who has only half that much water available must make a DC 10 Constitution save or suffer a level of exhaustion at the end of the day. A character with access to even less water suffers one automatic level of exhaustion that day.

If the character already has one or more levels of exhaustion, the character takes two levels in either case.

### Food

A one day supply of food is about equivalent to one pound of supplies. A character can go 3 + Constitution modifier days without food. If a character eats half a pound of food, that counts as going half a day without food. A normal day of eating resets the count of days without food to zero.

After that time period, a character automatically suffers a level of exhaustion for each day without food, or must make a DC Constitution save or take a level of exhaustion for each day of eating half a pound of food.

## Food and Creature Size

The rules for food and water assume that the characters are size Medium. Creatures of different sizes, including non-humanoids such as horses, need different amounts of sustenance.

Small creatures consume half as much food and water.

Large creatures consumer four times as much.

Huge creatures require sixteen times as much.

Gargantuan needs 32 times the supplies.

Colossal require 64 times as much food and water.

## Optional Wilderness Exploration Rules

The basic exploration rules cover all the basic movements of managing a journey from one place to the next. The following, optional rules add more detail and realism to the process by introducing specific tasks that the characters can take while traveling. They are especially useful for when the characters travel into the deep wilderness, far from any civilized lands.

### Exploration Tasks

An exploration task is a duty a character assumes for the duration of an exploration turn, a duty that usually contributes to the group's overall disposition and preparedness. Characters choose their tasks during the first step of an exploration turn.

After the group has agreed on its pace, explain to the players what their choices are for exploration tasks and ask what task each character will undertake. When a party is traveling at a fast pace, there's no time for characters to perform any of these tasks.
When each character has chosen a task, have the players roll ability checks to determine the outcome of their characters' tasks, then resolve any situations that arise from the success or failure of those checks.

A character can perform up to two tasks during an exploration turn, but dividing one's attention and energy is risky. If a character takes two actions, any ability checks associated with those actions have disadvantage.

Activities that require an action during a combat round, such as casting a spell, don’t count as exploration tasks. There’s no hard limit on the number of such activities a character can perform.

### Foraging

The characters can gather food and water as they travel, especially if they are running low on supplies. When a character chooses this task, the character makes a single Wisdom (Survival] check with a DC determined by the abundance of food and water in the region. If the check succeeds, that character finds a quantity of pounds of food and gallons of water equal to the 1d6 + the character's Wisdom modifier.

If multiple characters choose this task, they each make separate ability checks. More characters foraging can find food to feed more people.

FORAGING DCS

Terrain	| DC

Abundant	| 10

Average	| 15

Desolate	| 20


### Keeping Watch

It helps to keep an eye and an ear open for danger. When a character chooses keeping watch as an exploration task, the character makes a single Wisdom (Perception] check to detect hidden creatures and an Intelligence (Search] check to detect hidden objects as the group travels during the current exploration turn. A character’s check result is used to contest the checks of any creatures that are attempting to hide from the explorers. If someone keeping watch detects a creature, it cannot surprise the group.

### Mapmaking

Making an accurate map is vital to ensuring that explorers have the best sense of their surroundings. It can also help keep them from becoming lost.

When a character chooses mapmaking as an exploration task, the character must have a writing instrument and some surface (such as paper or parchment] on which to record the map.

The map a character creates might be similar to your actual map of the area, but not as complete. When you give out information to a player whose character is mapping, restrict that information to only what the character would perceive while “actually” performing the task.

If more than one character chooses this task, those who do so simply create multiple maps of the area. (This strategy can prove useful if one character’s map is lost or destroyed later in the adventure.]

### Navigating

Traveling in the wilderness or a large, unfamiliar city carries the risk of becoming lost. A character can reduce this risk by navigating for the group, keeping a careful eye out for landmarks and the position of the sun, the moon, and stars.
When a character chooses navigating as an exploration task, the character makes a single Wisdom (Survival] check to prevent the group from losing its way during the current exploration turn. If more than one member of the group chooses this task, each navigator makes a check, and you use the best result to determine if the group becomes lost.

### Sneaking

Keeping a low profile is often the best option in a dangerous area. When a character chooses sneaking as an exploration task, the character makes a single Dexterity (Stealth] check to hide as the group travels. Anyone who chooses this task has advantage on this check if the group’s travel pace is slow. To notice a sneaking character, a creature must contest the character’s check, using Wisdom (Perception] or Intelligence (iNVESTIGATION], and win.

### Improvised Tasks

A character might think of some way to contribute to an exploring group that isn't covered by the tasks described here. If so, you can allow the use of an improvised exploration task, but only if its performance requires no more than one-third of the time encompassed by an exploration turn. Also, as with other tasks, a character can't perform an improvised task if the group's travel pace is fast.

### CAMPING

Characters can carry a tent to protect themselves against wind and rain, but sometimes they don't have access to that kind of gear, and in those situations they can try to find a natural shelter or build one using materials they can gather. 

**Natural shelters** are divided in two types: basic and advanced Basic Shelter. Almost every natural shelter found in the wild is considered as a basic shelter. This shelter has enough space for 4 medium-sized creatures, and in general they're constructed from many small pieces of vegetation. Due to its simple design, a basic shelter protects against wind or precipitation (determined by the DM)

**Advanced Shelter.** An advanced shelter have space for 6 medium-sized creatures or more and protects everyone inside against the wind rain, snow and other environmental features. Additionally, an advanced shelter helps to maintain the personal temperature and in some cases it also provides some defenses against wild creatures.

### NATURAL SHELTERS

Terrain and time are the mayor factors that determines the chance for adventurers to be able to locate a natural shelter or construct something out of materials they find the zone.

Arctic zones has no useful vegetation that adventurers can use for shelter, but they can find crevasses and make improvised snow walls that can provide some protection.

Desert zones has no vegetation that adventurers can use, but they can run across irregularities in the surface, such as large rocks and some dunes that can provide shelter on at least one side.

Forest zones are one of the easiest terrains to find natural shelter. Trees and large plants can give adventurers some protection from wind and rain. In a forest, boughs or branches can be cut from trees and laid across a grid of poles to give characters a roof over their heads and protection from wind mils are full of irregular terrain that can serve as a simple windbreak. Additionally, thick vegetation is fairly abundant during most of the year, allowing adventurers to fashion a windbreak out of it.

Mountains, for this purpose, are considered to be rough, rocky areas with little or no vegetation. However, adventurers can come across some natural features, such as caves and alcoves that are large enough for the group.

Plains are generally flat, but not necessarily featureless. A small gully might help adventurers to get out of the wind Additionally, if a plain has some vegetation, characters may be able to gather enough branches and greenery for a windbreak.

Swamps commonly have vegetation that can be scavenged and used as shelter, and characters can come across a fallen tree or similar feature that can help as a shelter.

### FINDING NATURAL SHELTER

Characters can make a Wisdom (Survival) check to try to find a natural shelter in the area. Depending on the terrain, the difficulty and time to find an appropriate shelter varies, as shown in the following table.

Terrain	DC	Time Needed
Arctic	25	30 minutes
Desert	25	30 minutes
Forest	TO	10 minutes
Hills	TO	10 minutes
Mountains	20	20 minutes
Plains	20	20 minutes
Swamps	15	1 5 minutes

#### ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS

You can increase the DC and time depending on some special conditions, such as looking for a shelter in the night or while it's raining.

*	Rain, fog and low visibility areas. Increase the DC by 3 and add half the base time.

*	Storm, snowfall and no visibility areas. Increase the DC by 5 and it takes twice the base time.

UPGRADING A SHELTER
While characters can look for natural shelter, they can also gather materials and upgrade a basic shelter into an advanced shelter or add extra features, such as a palisade wall or other defensive measures.
COLLECTING MATERIALS
A character can gather materials by making an Wisdom (Survival) check or a Strength (Athletics) check. Use the table under the Finding Natural Shelter part to determine the DC and time used for collecting materials. During this activity, the character gather branches and vegetation that is lying in the area, cut down a tree to collect wood or mine a big rock to collect stones. 
On a success, it collects a number of units equal to 2d6 + its Constitution modifier. A character can make a number of checks per day equal to twice its Constitution modifier (minimum 1)
UPGRADING
For upgrading a shelter, the character must use a number of units of materials depending on which feature they want, as shown in the table below. Multiple characters can combine their efforts toward the upgrading of the shelter, reducing the time by ten times its Constitution modifier for each character working on the upgrade to a minimum of 10 minutes. For example, a character with a Constitution modifier of +2 will reduce the time it takes to finish a shelter feature by 20 minutes.
Feature	Units Required	Time
Advanced shelter upgrade	15	4 hours
Basic wall	6	1 hour
Platform	10	2 hours

Advanced Shelter Upgrade. Upgrading a basic shelter into an advanced shelter includes a door, simple roofing and walls made from various pieces of thatch, wood, stone or similar. Upgrading a shelter allows up to 6 medium-sized creatures to enter and protect themselves.

Basic Wall This 15-feet long, 6 feet tall fence or wall is made from wooden stakes, tree trunks, adobe or even bones, and it’s used as a defensive structure or enclosure. Each 5 feet of wall has an AC 15,15 hit points and a damage threshold of
Platform. This 10-foot square wooden platform is attached on a large tree, or raised on piles over the soil enabling to build on it. The platform can be built up to 10 feet high and includes a simple wooden staircase to access the platform.
Spike barrier. A 10-feet long barrier with many wooden or bone spikes. The area covered by the barrier is considered difficult terrain. Any creature that moves through the spike wall must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 10) or take ld4 piercing damage. The barrier has an AC 15,15 hit points and a damage threshold of 5.
Stone Wall A stone wall is a 15-feet long, 6 feet tall wall made from brick-and-mortar, used as a defensive structure or enclosure. Each 5 feet of wall has an AC 17, 30 hit points and a damage threshold of 10.
Some of this upgrades might not available to build in certain terrains due the type of materials needed For example, a spike barrier might be hard to craft in a desert since it requires wood or large bones.

ADDITIONAL FEATURES
While the upgrading features covers the most basic and generic ones, you can also create new ones, such as a clay oven, wooden furniture and such for creating a survival-themed campaign.


## Getting Lost

The characters might become lost. Explorers who are following a road or some other form of path or trail can’t become lost in normal circumstances.

If the characters might become lost, make note of the Wisdom (Survival] check result of any character who chose navigating during the current exploration turn (or the highest result, if more than one character performed this task]. If no one did so, treat the check result as 0. The DC for this check corresponds to the readiness of the group, as determined by its travel pace, plus a modifier based on the terrain (see the table].

If any character performed mapmaking as a task during the current exploration turn, the DC is reduced by 5.

Terrain	| DC Modifier

Forest, swamp, jungle, mountains	| +5

Light forest jungle, hills, desert, tundra	| 0

Plains, prairie	| -5

Success. If the navigator’s Wisdom (Survival] check succeeds, the characters successfully travel the distance and in the direction they want.

Failure. If the check fails, the characters inadvertently travel in the wrong direction. Halfway through their travel in the current turn, you roll a d4 to determine how the group has deviated from its intended course.

d4	| Deviation

1	| 90 degrees left
2	| 45 degrees left
3	| 45 degrees right
4	| 90 degrees right


For example, for a group intending to move north, a roll of 1 indicates that the characters are now actually heading west; a roll of 3 means that their course has (unknown to them] shifted to the northeast.

This change of direction applies only to the characters’ travel during the last half of the current turn. On the next turn, if the chance of getting lost still exists, the characters make another check. If that check fails, they continue to be unaware of their change in heading. On a successful check, the characters realize they have moved off course and in what direction.

The characters might not realize they are lost unless they encounter an obstacle that indicates they are heading in the wrong direction. If the characters realize they have lost their way, you stop rolling for deviation in their course until they fail another check to avoid becoming lost.


ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS

In this section you can find new environmental hazards, which follows similar rules as traps or lair actions. To determine the DC and damage, use the following tables

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HAZARD EXAMPLES		

AVALANCHES, ROCKFALLS AND MUDSLIDES
Any Level of Hazard
Any character in the area where the hazard occurs must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes bludgeoning damage and is buried by the hazard, or half as much damage on a successful one. The area is filled with snow, rubble or mud and becomes difficult terrain.
Any buried creature is considered suffocated, and it can dig through to free itself. To do so, the creature must succeed a number of Strength (Athletics) checks, as shown in the following table.
Hazard Level	Number of Checks
Setback	2
Dangerous	3
Deadly	4

HAILSTORM

Dangerous Hazard

Similar to a blizzard, the terrain affected by the hailstorm is considered difficult terrain. When a creature without proper shelter is in the area affected by the hailstorm for one hour, it must make a Constitution saving throw, taking cold damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.


A cloud of swarming insects fills a 20-foot-radius sphere. The swarm moves at 20 feet on each round When a creature enters the cloud it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes piercing damage, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the cloud must roll another saving throw. A creature cannot be damaged by the insect swarm if it’s wielding a torch or if it is at least 5 feet from a fire.

BLIZZARD
Setback Hazard
The area affected by a blizzard is considered difficult terrain. When a creature without proper shelter is in the area affected by the blizzard for one hour, it must make a Constitution saving throw, taking cold damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. If a creature is wearing warm clothing, it has advantage on the saving throw.
EARTHQUAKES
Any Level of Hazard
A tremor shakes the area; each creature on the ground in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.
The hazard level is determined by the proximity to the epicenter or the intensity of the earth tremor:
•	Setback. Far from the epicenter or light earthquake.
•	Dangerous. Near the epicenter or moderate earthquake.
•	Deadly. Very close to the epicenter or severe earthquake.
ELEMENTAL CLOUD
Any Level of Hazard
This cloud is made with elemental essence. When a creature enters the cloud, it must make an appropriate saving throw, taking damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the cloud must roll another saving throw.
Cloud Color	Damage Type	Saving Throw
Black	Necrotic	Constitution
Cyan	Cold	Constitution
Gray and Yellow	Lightning	Dexterity
Light Green	Acid	Constitution
Purple	Psychic	Wisdom
Red	Fire	Constitution
White	Force	Intelligence
LAVA
Deadly Hazard
The lava is considered difficult terrain. Any creature that enters the lava takes fire damage. A creature that ends its turn in the lava takes fire damage. 
LIGHTNING STORMS
Dangerous or Deadly Hazard 

 

The DM rolls a dlOO to determine if any creature is hit by a lightning.
This check can be made at the beginning of each turn during a combat or in any time while the party is not in combat.
dlOO	Number of Creatures
1-50	0
51-70	ld4
71-20	1 d 6
81-90	1 d8
91-100	1 d 10


The creatures hit by a lightning are determined by the DM, and any creature in the area under total cover from above cannot take damage.
MAGMA ERUPTIONS
Dangerous Hazard
Magma erupts from a point on the ground, creating a 20-foot- high, 5-foot-radius geyser. Each creature in the geyser's area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

ROGUE WAVE
Dangerous Hazard
POISON CLOUDS AND SPORES
Setback Hazard
When a creature enters the cloud, it must make a Constitution saving throw, taking poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the cloud must make another saving throw.

DANGEROUS TERRAINS
In the following section you can find survival considerations and hazards for various terrains. You can combine different terrains to create a more dynamic (and probably more deadly) environment.
ARCTIC
Cold and Extreme Cold The temperatures in this environment are lower than other places, and you need proper gear for resisting this temperatures. Whenever the temperature is at or below 0 degrees Fahrenheit, you must follow the rules of extreme cold
A	k
EXTREME COLD (DMC, P.110)
Whenever the temperature is at or below 0 degrees Fahrenheit, a creature exposed to the cold must succeed on a DC 1 0 Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour or gain one level of exhaustion. Creatures with resistance or immunity to cold damage automatically succeed on the saving throw, as do creatures wearing cold weather gear (thick coats, gloves, and the like) and creatures naturally adapted to cold climates.
^	r
Food Scarcity. It's hard to find food like plants and creatures due the low temperatures. All the checks for foraging and hunting have a DC equal to 20.
Shelter. In general, the arctic areas are vast frozen plains with big glaciers and rocks, making it difficult to find a natural shelter.

CAVES


Darkness and Light. Most of the natural caves don't have light sources, so anyone who enters must bring their sources of light and fire for warmth, cooking and in some cases, defense. A caves might have some light sources, such as groups of fluorescent fungus or other dangerous light sources, like lava.
Orientation and tracking. Inside a cave it's almost impossible to determine where's North: lots of caves are just tunnels connected, making it more difficult to create an accurate map of it.
Flooding. Some parts of the caves might be close to a water source or any other liquid that can quickly fill a room.

DESERT		


Heat and Extreme Heat. The opposite of the arctic terrain, temperatures in this environment are higher than other places, and you need enough water supplies for resisting the heat. Whenever the temperature is at or above 100 degrees Fahrenheit, you must follow the rules of extreme heat.
A	k
EXTREME HEAT (DMC, P.UO)
When the temperature is at or above 1 00 degrees Fahrenheit, a creature exposed to the heat and without access to drinkable water must succeed on a Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour or gain one level of exhaustion. The DC is 5 for the first hour and increases by 1 for each additional hour. Creatures wearing medium or heavy armor, or who are clad in heavy clothing, have disadvantage on the saving throw. Creatures with resistance or immunity to fire damage automatically succeed on the saving throw, as do creatures naturally adapted to hot climates.
^	r
Shelter. In general, the desert areas are just sand and rocks (in some areas they might be some scattered shrubs) making it difficult to find a safe campsite.
Strong Wind A strong wind imposes disadvantage on ranged weapon attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing. A strong wind also extinguishes open flames, disperses fog, and makes flying by nonmagical means nearly impossible. A flying creature in a strong wind must land at the end of its turn or fall
A strong wind in a desert can create a sandstorm that imposes disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
Water Scarcity. Finding water in a desert is extremely difficult, unless you're near an Oasis. All checks made for getting water have a DC equal to 20.

FORESTS AND JUNGLES
Density. Sometimes is hard to walk through a forest due the great number of plants, trees and vegetation. In most of the cases, you can't walk in a straight line through the forest. Orientation and tracking. Inside a forest, the trees covers the sky, making it hard to determine where's North, and depending the density of the forest it might be harder to keep a track.
Sight and hearing. It might be more difficult to see or hear your surroundings because the density of the forest, the tree shadows, obstacles (such a fallen tree) and the sound of the trees and vegetation moving with the wind

LAKES, RIVERS AND OCEAN


Orientation and tracking. In the middle of the ocean or under a storm, it's difficult to determine the cardinal points without the proper tools.
Shipwrecks. In the ocean, lakes and even in rivers there're rocks, icebergs, and more that can damage or destroy a ship or boat.
Water streams. The river streams can change drastically depending on the terrain around the rivers, like the terrain elevation, inclination and waterfalls.

MOUNTAINS		


Altitude. When you're traveling at altitudes of 10,000 feet or higher above sea level, you must follow the high altitude rules. Strong wind A strong wind imposes disadvantage on ranged weapon attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing. A strong wind also extinguishes open flames, disperses fog, and makes flying by nonmagical means nearly impossible. A flying creature in a strong wind must land at the end of its turn or fall
A strong wind in a desert can create a sandstorm that imposes disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
A	K.
HIGH ALTITUDE (DMC, P.110)
Traveling at altitudes of 1 0,000 feet or higher above sea level is taxing for a creature that needs to breathe, because of the reduced amount of oxygen in the air. Each hour such a creature spends traveling at high altitude counts as 2 hours for the purpose of determining how long that creature can travel.
Breathing creatures can become acclimated to a high altitude by spending 30 days or more at this elevation. Breathing creatures can't become acclimated to elevations above 20,000 feet unless they are native to such environments.

SWAMPS


Clean water. Swamps are characterized by having slow- moving and stagnant waters, being harder to find drinkable water. Drinking stagnant water might cause diseases. Warmth. The swamps are wet and soggy, so finding dry resources for making a fire it's almost impossible.
Low visibility. Mist, fog and lowlands are common in this terrain, and they reduces the visibility of any creature.

SPECIAL TERRAINS
In the wilderness, there're places that have been touched by ancient magic or energies for centuries, creating a persistent effect on those lands. Here're some ideas for creating special terrains you can add to flesh a particular zone in the wild
BLOOD ROCK
This area was part of old and forgotten ceremonial sacrifices, a massive battle between armies that fought for centuries or the place where a powerful otherwordly creature was slain. The area is covered by stones with a red tone, bones covered by dirt and mud and dry blood Any creature standing in this area can score a critical hit on a 19 or 20.
Long-Term Effect: A creature must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw at the end of each hour. On a failed save, the creature must use its action each round to attack the nearest creature it sees. At the end of each of its turns, the creature can make a new Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the effect ends until another hour passes.
DEATH CIRCLE RUINS
This area surrounded by dark stone pillars is infused with necrotic energy. Any healing effect, such as a cure wounds spell only heals half the total amount in this area.
Long-Term Effect: A living creature must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour. On a failed save, its hit point maximum is reduced by ld6. To recover the reduced hit points, the creature must spend 1 hour outside the area covered by the death circle ruins.
DEFILED GROUND
The dark energy fills this area, attracting undead creatures to this area. Any undead creature gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls while standing in the defiled ground Additionally, when an undead is reduced to 0 hit points, roll a d20. On a 10 or higher, the undead creature rises with 1 hit point on its next turn. If an undead is reduced to 0 hit points by radiant damage, it cannot roll for rising again.
Long-Term Effect: A creature must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour. On a failed save, it takes 5 necrotic damage.
GRAB GRASS
This thick, tough grass grows in areas constantly touched by Feywild magic that clings to characters and creatures that falls prone. An area covered by grab grass is considered difficult terrain, and any creature that falls prone in this area must make a Strength (Athletics) check to stand up (DC 10)
LIFE CIRCLE RUINS
This area surrounded by white stone pillars is infused with pure life energy. Every 1 minute, any living creature that begins its turn in the area regains 2 hit points.
Long-Term Effect: Any living creature that stays in this area for 1 hour can end either one disease or one condition afflicting it. The condition can be blinded, deafened, paralyzed or poisoned
PLANETOUCHED
Due to planar energy, a powerful artifact or some other factor, this terrain boosts certain types of energy related to one plane. Pick one damage type from the following list: Acid Cold Fire, Force, Lightning, Necrotic, Psychic or Radiant. Any attack that deals the chosen damage type deals an extra ld6 damage of that type.
SACRED SHRINE
A sacred shrine is dedicated to a particular deity, infusing with divine energy the area nearby. A creature that shares the deity's alignment gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls while standing in the area covered by the shrine.
Long-Term Effect: A creature that has a different alignment to the deity's alignment must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw at the end of each hour. On a failed save, it has disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures that shares the deity's alignment. At the end of each of its turns, the creature can make a new Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the effect ends until another hour passes.



KNOWLEDGE CHECKS
During the course of an adventure, players may encounter things that their characters may know about, but which they do not. Doing this makes heavy use of Intelligence- based skills (Arcana, History, Nature, and Religion especially).
Usually these checks are made without much trouble. When a player wants to know about a creature during combat, however, combat can be slowed down. To make a check to recall information about a creature, an object, or anything else, a character must use their action or reaction to do so.
A check to identify a creature and its general strengths has a DC of 10 + half the creature’s CR. This increases by 5 if the creature is not from the Material Plane. Succeeding by 5 or more also recalls some or all of the creature’s specific abilities and weaknesses.

CHARISMA CHECKS
Charisma checks and their corresponding skills can be a point of contention. Firstly, they are not a replacement for roleplaying—trying to get one’s point across and interacting with an NPC should be a precursor to any Charisma check in situations that are not simply handwaved during shopping, downtime, or other bookkeeping tasks.
Charisma checks are often better treated as a way to see how a situation pans out, in a more meta sense. A 
high Charisma (Persuasion) check, even with poor reasoning beforehand, can simply show that an NPC is willing to give the character the benefit of the doubt. A poor Charisma (Intimidation) roll, even if the odds are stacked against the NPC, may reveal that the NPC has a sudden boost of morale from a secret plan he or she has. And a poor Charisma (Deception) check, even if what the PC said is totally believable, may show that the NPC is simply a suspicious type who has a nose for danger.
In this way, Charisma can be seen not just as force of will in a direct sense, but a type of social luck—the ability for things to go well for a player character. After all, luck is an important skill to have as an adventurer.
Charisma checks with NPCs are usually contested by Wisdom (Insight) checks. To avoid undue rolling and putting the need for luck on the players’ shoulders, it is usually best to use the NPC’s passive Insight score. Depending on the situation and the actions of the character, this score can be modified. Use the Insight Modifiers table as a guideline. Try to limit the modifiers to 2 or less: one for the NPC’s attitude toward the character, and another for the situation.

ACROBATICS
Acrobatics is not a replacement for the Athletics skill. Instead, it has very specific implementations that are usually done passively or as part of some other action: keeping one’s balance, slipping out of tight spaces, and of course performing acrobatic stunts.
ACROBATICS DCS
Check DC	Situation
5	Walk in a straight line with your arms out to either side.
10	Keep one's footing on an icy surface in combat.
15	Perform a standing backflip, or walk across a tightrope.
20	Perform a quadruple somersault during a jump.
25	Cartwheel across a tightrope.
30	Walk across a frictionless surface.
ANIMAL HANDLING
Animal Handling sees perhaps the least use in most campaigns. If someone takes it, try to give them a few chances to use it, even if it’s only once or twice every few sessions.
 
ANIMAL HANDLING DCS
Check DC	Situation
5	Command a healthy, trained animal to do a trick it knows.
10	Command a healthy, trained animal to do a trick it doesn't know, or to put itself in harm's way.
15	Get an untrained animal to do what you want, for its benefit.
20	Get an untrained animal to attack an enemy or otherwise put itself in harm's way.
25	Get an injured and untrained animal to put itself in harm's way.
30	Command a cat to bark.


If the check is made under external threats, such as during combat or while avoiding an ongoing lava flow, increase the DC by 5. Having something the animal wants (especially food) can give a character advantage on the check.
ARCANA
The Arcana skill is not just for recalling information about magic, identifying spells and such. It can be used to figure out how a magical device functions, or to disable magical traps. Given the nature of Dungeons & Dragons’ settings, the Arcana skill should have plenty of instances to shine.
Arcana is also the most versatile knowledge skill when it comes to monsters. It can be used to recall information about the abilities of most aberrations, celestials, most constructs, elementals, fey, fiends, monstrosities created by magic, some oozes, and most undead, as Arcana covers knowledge about spells, magic, and the planes all in one.
ARCANA DCS
Check DC	Situation
Varies	Identify a spell, either as it's being cast or by its effects (DC 10 + the spell's level).
5	Recognize that an effect is magical.
10	Determine whether a creature or object is magical in origin, and recall information about it if it's common.
15	Recognize the type of magic of an effect (whether it's of arcane, divine, psionic, or some other type of origin). Recall the common inhabitants of another plane of existence, or recognize the influence of another plane on an area.
20	Recall information related to a legendary item or artifact's origin and powers, or about the state and effects of another plane of existence.

ATHLETICS DCS 

Check DC	Climbing Examples	Jumping Examples	Swimming Examples
5	Climbing a steep hill or slope.	Making your normal jump distance with a running start.	Swimming through calm waters.
10	Climbing a tree or a steep, rough incline.	Jumping 5 feet further or 2 feet higher than normal with a running start, or avoiding a low ceiling or waist-high obstacle during a long jump.	Swimming through rough waters.
15	Climbing a tall pole or totem, or dungeon- or ruin-style stone walls.	Jumping your long jump distance without a running start, or jumping 10 feet further or 4 feet higher than normal with a running start.	Swimming through stormy waters.
20	Climbing a brick wall or rock cliff.	Jumping 15 feet further or 6 feet higher than normal with a running start.	Swimming up a fast- moving river.
25	Climbing a tall, sheer cliff, or a wall made of shaped stone.	Jumping twice your normal jump distance with a running start.	Swim through a giant whirlpool.
30	Climbing a wall of force.	Jumping twice your normal jump distance without a running start, or three times as much with a running start.	Swimming up a waterfall.
The DC for a given climbing example increases by 5 if the surface is slick with liquid but decreases by 5 if you have decent handholds or a properly-secured rope.

Climbing, jumping, and swimming should remain purely in the playhouse of Strength. Dexterity and the Acrobatics skill should not be applied to these given activities, to keep Strength a relevant, obvious solution to problems these can solve.
Example DCs can be found in the Athletics DCs table.
Climbing. Scaling an incline is an easy task that should not require an ability check, even a steep one given generous handholds. Failure should not mean a deadly fall. A Dexterity saving throw of a lesser DC can sometimes be allowed to stay in place. In most cases, failing simply causes one to slide back down unless under immediate duress and threat of injury.
Calling for a check at all is only really required if the situation is appropriately dangerous. An entire party could scale a steep cliff without much effort, so long as there is nothing nipping at their heels or waiting at the top for them.
Jumping. The Athletics skill states that it can be used to jump unusually long distances. Only call for such a check if a character could not make it with their default jumping distance, detailed in the rules for movement.
 
DECEPTION
Due to its situational nature, Deception is usually used in contests alone, opposed by an NPC’s Wisdom (Insight) check. Generally, it’s best to use passive Insight scores to set a DC for the check, with adjustments based on the attitude of the NPC. Insight in this case is used in its closest rules-as-written form, allowing an NPC to detect whether a PC is pulling their leg.
The Insight Modifiers table in the previous section contains guidelines for modifying an NPC’s Insight score to set a DC for a character’s Charisma (Deception) checks.
HISTORY
Unlike Arcana, History is dedicated almost entirely to recalling information. Its use is quite specific as well. In a pinch, the skill can be used past its normal intentions to recall information about the local region, such as local nobles, recent battles, and local feuds or problems.
It can also be used to recall information about particularly impactful monsters. Information about dragons, giants, and humanoids tends to fit best in the History skill. Depending on the setting, it may help recall information about other monsters, such as the role of aberrations in Eberron.
INSIGHT
Insight is yet another skill used in contests more often than flat checks. Unlike NPCs, PCs do not get situational bonuses to their Wisdom (Insight) checks, instead relying on the player’s own wit. However, in a pinch with no leads, a character can make a DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check to get a hunch that something is amiss or not. If the DM so 
decides, he or she may provide the player with some sort of hint to go along with the hunch, such as “People’s eyes keep glancing at the beautiful tapestry on the far wall” to denote that people might be hiding something.
On a failed check to notice an NPC’s bluff, the DM should be careful not to show their hand. Too often, even a failed check can tell the player that their suspicions are at least partially correct, instead of revealing little or no information. When describing a failure to detect a bluff, try to say that a character has trouble getting a good read on the NPC, rather than saying that the character finds the NPC trustworthy.
HISTORY DCS
Check DC	Situation
5	Recall common information about the recent past.
10	Recall uncommon information about events in the last 5 years.
15	Recall hidden information about the last century.
20	Recall hidden information about the last millennium, or information about something purposely destroyed or wiped from most historical records.
25	Recall hidden information about the distant past, so long as it was recorded in some way.
30	Recall, in perfect detail, any event from the distant past.
INTIMIDATION
Like Deception, Intimidation is often contested by a Wisdom (Insight) check or, more smoothly, an NPC’s passive Insight score. The Insight Modifiers table in the previous section contains guidelines for modifying an NPC’s Insight score to set a DC for a character’s Charisma (Intimidation) checks.
Many players attempt to use this skill in combat. While tempting, the DM should not use the frightened condition in this case, as it steps on the toes of many class features and spells. Instead, use Intimidation checks as a way to affect morale. A high Intimidation check accompanied by the slaying an opponent may cause weaker enemies to retreat. A low Intimidation check may make stronger enemies more aggressive. In either case, the Insight skill is used to represent not just a creature’s ability to read a situation but also to show their self-awareness, whether they can avoid being overcome by fear in the heat of battle or not.
INVESTIGATION
This skill is the “black sheep” of the fifth edition skill system. Often confused with Perception in its use, the difference between the two is often vague, both in rules and in various official adventures.
The best way to illustrate this is with a common Dungeons & Dragon element: traps. Perception can be used to spot a trap. You can see the shine of torchlight on a trip 
wire, or the slight separation between stones indicating a pressure plate. Investigation allows you to figure out how a trap works. It lets you notice that the trip wire is likely attached something that comes down from the slots in the ceiling, or that the pressure plate likely has to do with the holes in the walls.
It may also be better to think about them in terms of scale. Perception is for things that are obvious, out in the open. You could notice them at a glance, given a high enough awareness. Investigation is for seeing smaller-scale things, such as that a single book in a bookcase is out of place, with a different subject than the others.
Like Insight, Investigation can be used by DMs to move a campaign along. If players have found clues but aren’t connecting them, an Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Investigation) check may help them put 2 and 2 together.
INVESTIGATION DCS
Check DC	Situation
5	Notice that one person in a lineup is of a different race than the others.
10	Determine the weakest pillar holding up an aging ruin's ceiling, or notice that one person in a crowd has a limp.
15	Determine that a letter contains a secret message, or pour over a text and find a specific passage quickly.
20	Find the single brick in a wall that, when pushed, opens a secret door.
25	Spot a secret message hidden in the specific wording of an ancient text.
30	Find a needle in a haystack.


MEDICINE
Yet another underused skill, Medicine can have more uses than just stabilizing a dying ally in combat. Medicine can be used in place of other Intelligence-based checks to recall information and determine the nature of poisons and diseases, especially when they are affecting a creature. In many cases, Intelligence (Medicine) checks are even more apt than Wisdom (Medicine) checks, though medicine in D&D is often based on gut-feelings rather than the modern method of rote learning.
MEDICINE DCS
Check DC	Situation
5	Determine that someone has a cold. Recall how to treat common ailments.
10	Identify fresh wounds and determine how they were made in most cases.
15	Determine the exact cause of death of the recently deceased. Determine how to treat a rare poison or disease.
20	Identify a specific poison or disease by only cursory descriptions or symptoms.


Check DC	Situation
25	Find the cure or treatment for a magical disease.
30	Raise a creature that has recently died not through magic but your skill alone.
NATURE	


Nature is one of the wider Intelligence skills, usable in a host of situations, especially to recall information about beasts, the wilder dragons, many fey, primal humanoids, common monstrosities, and of course plants.
In some cases, Wisdom (Nature) checks may be appropriate. Consider allowing these for rangers and druids, who are close to nature but whose Intelligence scores are generally not all that high.
NATURE DCS Check DC Situation
5	Identify common plants and animals.
10	Recall that a neighboring desert is infamous for its ice storms, or that the local forest is guarded by vengeful fey.
15	Determine that a storm is artificial, that a cliff face is actually an unnatural façade, or that a specific animal usually isn't found in the area.
20	Identify that a creature is one-of-a- kind or possibly a new species.
25	Pinpoint the depth and epicenter of an earthquake from eyewitness reports.
30	Determine that a nearby mountain is going to erupt within the next few days.

PERCEPTION
Being one of the most-used skills, Perception needs little encouragement in its use. Perception is also the one skill focused on for passive scores. For NPCs, passive Perception use is a must to speed up play, but for characters, encouraging regular active use of the Perception skill can keep play active. While some say to use passive Perception as a hard minimum for Wisdom (Perception) checks, it can be useful to completely ignore it for active checks where failure could be more interesting, exciting, or dangerous.
PERCEPTION DCS
Check DC	Situation
5	Hear people talking in the next room, or see someone walking in the trees.
10	Hear people whispering in the next room.
15	Read the lips of someone across the room.

Check DC	Situation
20	Hear and understand whispers from a
	room over, or see the telltale signs of a
	secret door.
25	Hear an owl gliding in for a kill.
30	See the outline of an invisible creature.

PERSUASION
The last of the three major Charisma skills, Persuasion is also the most-used. Influencing an NPC to do what you want is an important skill to have! As such, it is often opposed by an NPC’s passive Insight score, with adjustments based on the attitude of the NPC as given in the Insight Modifiers table in the previous section.
In this case, using the Insight score might not make sense, at first. Just like Intimidation, consider the Insight score as a way to represent not only the ability to detect lies but a sort of luck created by situational awareness. A creature with a large bonus to Wisdom (Insight) checks is more likely to foresee negative outcomes to doing what the party wants or even associating with them.
The DM should try to only call for Charisma (Persuasion) checks when the NPC in question wouldn’t perform or refuse to perform the action in question. A close ally may already give their life for the party, but a villain will surely reject any requests the party makes that don’t fit their fell fancy.
Finally, the Persuasion skill can be used to handwave the gathering of rumors. Searching for information or rumors on a specific subject in a town might take a few hours and a DC 10 or 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check, allowing characters to move the story forward while others shop or rest.
RELIGION
Religion is the narrowest of the Intelligence skills. DMs coming from older editions often use it beyond its stated scope, though this has little impact on the game itself. In truth, Intelligence (Religion) checks may rarely come up in a game not involved with cults or religious organizations.
That’s not to say it’s completely useless. It can be used to recall information on many celestials, fiends, and some undead, as they relate to cults and deities.
RELIGION DCS


Check DC	Situation
5	Recognize holy symbols of common deities.
10	Recall the rites and major traditions of common religions, enough to fit in at a church.
15	Determine which deity or cult an ancient ruin was dedicated to, or recall information on local mythology.
20	Recognize the secret symbols and actions of cultists hiding their dealings in plain sight.
25	Recognize the symbols and myths of a god dead and buried for 10,000 years.
30	Improvise the proper rites of a long- dead religion to contact its sleeping god.

SLEIGHT OF HAND
This skill could, in many ways, simply be combined with the Stealth skill. However, it still does have its uses and can come up in play, if not all that often. This will mostly occur through the Steal action, but Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks can be used for pulling magic tricks or carefully manipulating small objects.
Like the Stealth skill, Sleight of Hand is almost always opposed by a creature’s Wisdom (Perception) check or passive Perception score, with almost no exceptions. A soft DC 10 can be used to perform some simple acts of manual trickery, such as using a fishhook and line to grab a set of keys from a jail cell.
STEALTH
Stealth is perhaps the most well-defined skill in Dungeons & Dragons. It is used for anything involving stealth, and it is always contested by a creature’s Wisdom (Perception) check or passive Perception score.
To smooth play, do not call for repeated Dexterity (Stealth) checks when a character is simply moving through an area. Instead, only ask for another check if the character is spotted or performs a specific action that could break their stealth. A Dexterity (Stealth) check of 17 could get a creature past most guards and sentries, even passing across doorways or moving within a few feet of an unaware guard. However, once a character attempts to take out a guard or after a character activates a trap, a second check may be worthwhile, as the situation can change dramatically.
SURVIVAL
Survival is yet another well-defined skill. The guidelines in the Dungeon Master’s Guide on foraging, navigation, and tracking all give solid DCs on the skill’s use.
When cook’s utensils aren’t available (or a character isn’t proficient in with them), Wisdom (Survival) checks can be used to determine if a proper meal is prepared by an unskilled chef. A DC of 10 is usually more than enough to produce something edible from wild game and plants, with a 15 or 20 giving a much-needed morale boost in the wilderness in the form of a delicious, if gamey, meal. This morale boost can be presented by temporary hit points, usually 1d4.

# MAGIC ITEMS

## Wearing Magic Items

In most cases, a magic item that’s meant to be worn will adjust its size to suit a creature regardless of the wearer’s gender or race. If you have a good reason for why a magic item shouldn’t fit, though, run with it. Armor made specifically by the self-absorbed drow might fit elves only. Dwarves might make items usable only by dwarf¬sized and dwarf-shaped characters to keep such items from being used against them. Such items should be exceptions, however, not the rule.

Use common sense to determine whether more than one of a given kind of magic item can be worn. Can a character wear two necklaces? Of course ! People in the real world wear multiple necklaces, amulets, medallions, and holy symbols at the same time, and there’s no prohibition against a character employing a necklace of fireballs while wearing an amulet of protection. Two belts? Sure, that’s easy to picture, perhaps with a weapon hanging from each one. But can a character wear two pairs of boots? No, that’s silly.

The simple rule is that a character can’t wear more than one pair of footwear (boots, sandals, slippers, and so on], more than one pair of gloves or gauntlets, more than one suit of armor, more than one cloak, or more than one item of headwear (a helmet, hat, circlet, crown, or similar item]. Feel free to impose other limits or grant exceptions where appropriate. For instance, a hat of disguise might allow the wearing of a mask or a circlet, but a character is unlikely to be able to wear two sets of bracers.

Items that are meant to function in pairs, including boots, bracers, gauntlets, and gloves, do not impart their benefits unless the entire pair is worn. A character can’t wear a boot of striding and springing on one foot and a boot of elvenkind on the other foot to use the properties of either or both magic items.

## Magic Item Attunement

Some magic items require a character to attune to them before the magical properties of those items can be enjoyed.

Attuning to a Magic Item: Attuning to a magic item requires that you first discover whether you can attune yourself to it. The identify spell is the most common way of discovering this fact. Unusual items magically reveal that fact to certain types of creatures or in certain circumstances.

The attunement process requires you to grasp or wear the item and spend 10 minutes concentrating on it. Depending on the nature of the item, this concentration can take the form of prayers, weapon practice, or meditation. In any case, the concentration period must be uninterrupted.

When you are attuned to an item, you can use any magical properties that require attunement. You also learn how to activate those abilities and any necessary command words or phrases to do so. See “Using a Magic Item” for different methods of magic item activation.
An item can be attuned to only one creature at a time. A magic item might require you to meet one or more prerequisites before you can become attuned to it.

## Using a Magic Item

Each magic item has one or more magical properties that it imparts to its user when properly held, wielded, or donned. How a user activates the item’s properties varies from item to item.

**Worn:** Many items must be worn to gain their benefits. A suit of armor must be donned, a shield strapped to the arm, a cloak fastened about the shoulders, a ring placed on a finger, and so on. Simply carrying around an item that’s meant to be worn is not sufficient to gain its benefits.

**Wielded:** Most magic weapon properties apply when the weapon is used in combat. A weapon might have properties that are useful when the item is drawn or held.

**Action Activated:** A magic item that falls into this category requires an action to activate. Potions, scrolls, and many wondrous items fall into this category.

Some item properties not only take an action to activate, but also require the item’s user to speak a command word or phrase. The command word or phrase must be spoken in an area where hearing is possible.

**Consumable:** Some magic items are used up when activated. Many consumable items are also action-activated items. Once activated, a consumable item loses its magic and no longer functions.

**Special Activations:** Sometimes a user must do something special to activate a magic item, as indicated in the magic item’s descriptive text.


### Magic armor +1

**Rare**

01-35	| Dragon leather
36-55	| Studded dragon leather
56-75	| Dragon scale

**Very rare**

01-40	| Mithral shirt
41-75	| Mithral scale
91-00	| Mithral plate

### Elven Chain

**Very rare magic armor (mithral shirt)**

Elven chain is exceptionally fine and light mithral chain mail, elaborately decorated with woven lines that twist like vines, and incorporating other precious metals, such as silver, gold, and platinum.

Donning the armor feels like slipping into a silk tunic, and the chain mail does not constrain the wearer’s movement. The magic woven into the elven chain enables the wearer to cast spells freely as well.

Mithral armor is usually made by dwarves, who mine the metal deep in the earth. Where dwarves and elves come together for trade or another common purpose, elven smiths craft fine shirts of the metal.

The elves guard elven chain jealously. In ancient times, they sometimes bestowed such armor on a dwarf who had earned their friendship, but generally it is meant for elves' use. A gift of such armor is a sign of deep respect.

**Property:** You can wear this armor as if you were proficient with it.

### Dagger of Venom

**Rare magic weapon (dagger)**

The black, obsidian blade of this weapon is serrated on one edge. Its pommel is carved to resemble two fanged serpents that twine together, their outstretched heads forming the blade’s quillon. Anyone wielding the blade notes a bitter, acrid scent from it.

A dagger of venom is most often crafted for the use of a yuan-ti or a powerful assassin. Each of these weapons has a distinct pattern to its blade or pommel that indicates its original owner. Assassins’ guilds and yuan-ti cults prize these blades as relics. If news of such a dagger reaches them, they send agents to collect the weapon by trickery or force.

**Property:** You gain a +1 bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls you make with this dagger. The saving throw DC of any poison you apply to the dagger increases by 2.

Once per day, you can use an action to cause thick, black poison to cover the dagger’s blade.

The poison remains for 1 minute or until you hit with an attack using this weapon. When you hit a living creature with this weapon while it’s coated in this poison, the creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it becomes paralyzed for 1 minute.

### Frost Brand

**Very rare magic weapon (long sword)**

The blade of this long sword is constantly rimed with frost and ice, and its hilt is wrapped in white leather. When it is drawn from its scabbard, nearby fires gutter, and a plume of condensing air steams from the weapon’s surface.

**Property:** You gain a +1 bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls you make with this weapon. On a hit with this weapon, you deal 1d6 extra cold damage.

While you have this sword drawn and in hand, you have fire resistance.

While drawn and in hand in freezing temperatures, the sword also sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for 10 feet beyond that.

Finally, once per hour, when you draw this weapon, you can choose to douse all nonmagical flames within 30 feet of you.

Wand of Binding

Rare magic wand

This wand is actually a length of chain held rigid by the magic that infuses it. The chain is crafted from adamantine, and runes of binding and imprisonment adorn each link.

Property [Attuned]: You must be a cleric, a druid, or a mage to become attuned to this item.

The wand has 7 charges. As an action, you can expend the specified number of charges to cast one of the following spells from the wand.

*	***hold person*** (2 charges]

*	***hold monster*** (6 charges]

If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand blackens and crumbles to dust, forever destroyed. The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges each day at dawn. In addition, while you hold the wand, you can expend a charge as a reaction whenever you make a saving throw to resist the hold person or the hold monster spell to gain advantage on your saving throw.

### Potion of Heroism

***Rare potion**

This colorless potion steams as if boiling.

Sampling or drinking it causes the imbiber to feel immensely healthy and robust.

**Property [Consumable]:** As an action, you drink the potion. You gain 10 temporary hit points. These hit points can cause you to exceed your hit point maximum, and they cannot be regained. If you take any damage, these hit points are lost first. In addition, you gain a +2 bonus to ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws. Finally, the saving throw DC of any spell you cast or magic item you use, or that results from something else you do by increases by 2.

The effects wear off after 1 hour.

### Ring of Wizardry
**Very rare ring**

Silver sigils of stars, comets, and suns are engraved on this bone ring.

Crafting a ring of wizardry involves several astounding feats of magic now lost to academic spellcasters. A mage must grow a clone, invest the clone with the knowledge of magic, and harvest a finger from it. From this finger’s bones a ring of wizardry is carved. A story exists about the “Nine-Fingered Mage,” a clone who escaped the complete ring-making process, but not soon enough to save every digit.

**Property (attuned):** If you are a wizard, add one to the number of spell slots you have for each level of spell you can cast up to 4th level.

### Cloak of Elvenkind
**Uncommon wondrous item**

This long cloak is fashioned from gray cloth, expertly crafted, and is half the weight of a normal cloak.

**An elf who sees a non-elf wearing a cloak of this sort might assume the cloak is stolen.** In some cases, however, cloaks of elvenkind are presented as gifts to the elves’ most trusted and valued allies.

Property: While you wear a cloak of elvenkind with the hood up, you can attempt to hide in any natural environment, as long as no creatures are within 20 feet of you. You do not have to be obscured to make the attempt, but you must stay quiet.

The transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look natural. Any creature that cannot see the area of the spell at the time the spell is cast must make a Wisdom (Perception] check against the spell’s saving throw DC to recognize the terrain as hazardous.

Barkskin now no longer requires concentration and reads as follows: “You touch a willing creature. The target’s skin takes on a rough, bark-like appearance for the spell’s duration, during which its AC becomes 16, if its AC is not already higher from wearing armor. The creature can benefit from wearing a shield as normal.”

EQUIPMENT
The following section provides new armor, weapon, and equipment types. Prices, weights, and other information are also listed on the Additional Shields, Additional Weapons, and Additional Adventuring Gear tables.
ARMOR AND SHIELDS
These new armor additions and shield types allow defensive characters a few more options.
ADDITIONAL ARMOR AND SHIELDS

Armor spikes. Armor spikes can be added to a set of medium or heavy armor for 150 gp, representing the price of the spikes and the expertise needed to add them to a set of armor.
While wearing armor with spikes, wrestling with you is a dangerous proposition. If you use the Attack action to grapple a creature within 5 feet of you and successfully do so, the creature takes 1d4 piercing damage. If the creature ends its turn being grappled by you in this way and is within 5 feet of you, it takes another 1d4 piercing damage. If the suit of armor is magical, the damage dealt by the spikes is also considered magical.
Buckler. While wielding a buckler, your Armor Class increases by 1. When you are wearing a buckler and are targeted by a melee weapon attack by a creature you can see, you can use your reaction to parry the blow, further increasing your AC by 2 against that attack.

When you take the Attack action and wielding a spiked shield, you can attack with it as a bonus action. Creatures that are proficient with regular shields are proficient with spiked shields, both as a shield and a weapon.
Targe. This shield is wielded in a way that leaves one’s hand open. While wearing a targe, your Armor Class increases by 1. You can use the hand you wield the targe in to manipulate objects, shove, grapple, or perform somatic spell components.
Creatures that are proficient with regular shields are proficient with targes.
Tower shield. While wielding a tower shield, your Armor Class increases by 3, but your speed decreases by 5 feet and you have disadvantage on Dexterity checks and saving throws. You provide three-quarters cover, instead of half cover, to other creatures. You can use your action to set the shield like a wall, giving yourself total cover against ranged attacks until the start of your next turn. Creatures that are proficient with heavy armor are proficient with tower shields.

WEAPON PROPERTIES
The following weapon property can be found among several entries in the Additional Weapons table.
Double. A double weapon has two ends with which you can attack. When you take the Attack action and attack with the weapon, you can engage in two-weapon fighting with it, treating one end as the required light weapon with the specified damage die.
SPECIAL WEAPONS
New weapons with special properties are described here.
Bola. When you hit a Large or smaller creature with a bola, it must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or be restrained by it. A creature can end this condition by breaking free of the bola, either by making a DC 10 Strength check as an action or by dealing 5 slashing damage to the bola. In either case, the bola is destroyed. A bola has an AC of 11. Formless creatures are immune to the effect of a bolas.
Boomerang. When you throw this weapon and miss, it returns to your hand. Creatures that are proficient with javelins are also proficient with boomerangs.
Composite bow. These bows use a complex design with a high draw weight. You add your Strength modifier alongside your Dexterity modifier to damage rolls for composite bows.
Garrote. When you attack with this weapon and hit, you immediately grapple the target if it is Large or smaller and is not formless. This grapple ends early if you let go of either end of the garrote. While grappled in this way, the creature is gagged, cannot breathe, and melee attacks against it are made with advantage. Rogues are proficient with garrotes.
Kusarigama. This double weapon has very different ends, attached by a chain: a sickle, dealing slashing damage; and a weight, dealing bludgeoning damage with the reach property. You can choose which end with which to attack. Monks are proficient with the kusarigama and can treat it as a monk weapon.
Parrying dagger. When you wield this weapon and are targeted by a melee weapon attack, you can use your reaction to increase your AC by 2 against that attack. Rogues are proficient with parrying daggers.
Repeating crossbows. These crossbows are fitted with cartridges that can hold up to six crossbow bolts. A repeating crossbow automatically reloads after firing until it runs out of ammunition. You can reload the cartridge as an action.

In either case, the effect ends early.
Thunderstone. As an action, you can throw a thunderstone up to 30 feet. When it strikes a hard surface or is struck hard, it creates a deafening bang and is destroyed. Creatures within 10 feet of the stone must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be deafened for 1 hour. If a creature deafened in this way casts a spell with verbal components, it must make a DC 11 Charisma saving throw or fail to cast the spell.
Tindertwig. You can strike the end of this small, wooden stick on a flammable object, requiring no action. The object immediately ignites and the tindertwig is destroyed.
