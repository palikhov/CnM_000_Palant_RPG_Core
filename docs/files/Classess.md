### Choked

The flow of air into your body is cut. You have limited reserve of air before you risk to fall unconscious equal to 3 plus your Constitution modifier (see pg. 183, *Player's Handbook*).

* At the start of your turn, if you took any amount of hit points damage since your last turn, you lose 1 round of air. Each critical hit you take makes you lose 1 extra round.
* At the end of your turn, if you are still being Choked, you lose 1 round of air.
* Each time you attempt to speak, cast a spell with verbal component, or say a command you lose 1 round of air.
* When you have no more rounds of air left, make a Constitution saving throw against DC 10 at the end of each of your turns. On failure, you fall  unconscious. Each time you repeat the check, the DC is increased by 5. 
* You have advantage to attempt to Escape being choked if you can use your both hands to struggle, unless you are Restrained or Pinned. 

### Frostbitten

Characters who are exposed to extreme cold without being prepared can experience both hypothermia and frostbite. If a character fails multiple consecutive Constitution saving throws against cold or extreme cold weather, he suffers the Frostbitten condition and suffers the following:
* **Two failures.** The creature's skin itches and becomes numb. Yellow and white patches form. The creature suffers disadvantage on checks that require fine manipulation, and on checks to resist being disarmed. The DC to resist disarming is decreased by 5.
* **Three or more failures.** Your skin develops black blisters, and your body is numb. You don’t feel the cold anymore, but you don’t feel much at all. Any manipulative activity like drawing or sheathing a weapon, taking something from a bag or pouch, or making an attack, requires a successful DC 12 Dexterity check to accomplish without fumbling and dropping the item. 

### Gagged

Your mouth is covered and you are preventing from speaking clearly, casting spells with a verbal component or speaking command words to activate magic items. 

* You can only make muffled sounds heard up to 15 feet range. The DM may increase the rage if your voice is particularly loud.
* You have advantage to attempts to Escape being gagged, unless you are Restrained or Pinned

\columnbreak

### Grappled

* A grappled creature’s speed becomes 0, and it can’t benefit from any bonus to its speed.
* The condition ends if the Grappler is incapacitated (see the condition).
* The condition also ends if an Effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the Grappler or Grappling Effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the Thunderwave spell.
* The condition ends when you successfully Escape from a Grapple. This also removes the Restrained and Pinned conditions. 

### Pinned

You are prone or pressed against hard surface while also restrained by an opponent who uses its body weight to keep you immobilized and restrained.

* You are both Grappled and Restrained while Pinned.
* You can use your action only to attempt to Escape the grappled condition. If you succeed, you are also no longer Grappled or Restrained by the opponent. 

### Restrained

* A restrained creature’s speed becomes 0, and it can’t benefit from any bonus to its speed.
* Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature’s Attack rolls have disadvantage.
* The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity Saving Throws.

### Unstable

In a snow sled vehicle that is moving at more than half its maximum speed through difficult terrain, you are constantly bracing against shaking and thrashing. You gain the Unstable condition. While you are unstable:

* You suffer -2 penalty to your Armor Class and to attack rolls with melee weapons. 
* You suffer disadvantage to ranged attacks unless you spend your action to aim. The aiming negates the disadvantage of your following ranged attack. 
* You suffer disadvantage to Strength and Dexterity saving throws, as well as any Dexterity ability checks.
* You treat the space within the sled vehicle as difficult terrain. Standing up or sitting down while in the sled consumes your whole movement.

A creature can attempt a proficient DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check at the start of its turn to negate the effect of Unstable condition until the end of its turn. 
# Exhaustion

___
The Exhaustion condition will be expanded in the *Rime of the Frostmaiden* campaign. Exhaustion is broken into two types - Light and Heavy. Light Exhaustion accumulates with strenuous physical activity such as heavy labor day or travel across difficult terrain. Heavy Exhaustion usually covers the ill effect of diseases, life drain, and can ultimately kill you.

Forcing yourself to keep going despite exhaustion requires strong will and determination. When you attempt an action that has a chance to increase your Exhaustion to a level that has a listed Ignore DC, you must make either a Constitution saving throw to muster the strength to do it, or a Wisdom saving throw to keep going on despite struggling. If you fail, you find an excuse not to do it but rather rest.

##### Light Exhaustion
| Level  | Ignore | Effect |
|:---:|:----:|:-----------|
|  1  | – | Disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity Ability and Skill checks. |
|  2  | – | Disadvantage on all Ability and Skill checks. Speed halved.  |
|  3  | 12 | Disadvantage on Attack rolls and Saving Throws. Rolling 1 on attack rolls and skill check leads to critical fumbles (up to the DM).  |

##### Heavy Exhaustion
| Level  | Ignore | Effect |
|:---:|:----:|:-----------|
|  4  | 15 | You can only take an action or a bonus action during your turn, and you can't take reactions. You're limited to simple mental tasks. |
|  5  | 20 | Speed reduced to 5. You are on the verge of passing out. You cannot concentrate or cast spells requiring Concentration. You have blurry vision, tunnel vision, or vertigo and may experience hallucinations (up to DM).  |
|  6  | 25 | You are Dying. Any additional Exhaustion counts as two failed death saves. |

### Exhaustion Recovery

At the end of a short rest, if you have exactly one level of Exhaustion you lose that level.

At the end of a long rest as long as you have consumed enough ration and water needed by your race to sustain life and have been able to sleep or similar restorative process, you lose one level of exhaustion. 

You can skip sleep and stay up one night but you lose the ability to recover exhaustion during short rest until you have a full sleep. You can skip sleep and stay up two or more nights in a row, but each night after the first you gain one level of exhaustion and must roll a saving throw to avoid falling asleep against the Ignore DC.

**Weather Sensor.** When used as an action, this device predicts the change in weather conditions in a 1-mile radius within the next 12 hours.

### Wood Elf Magic
___
**Prerequisites:** Elf (wood)
___
You learn the magic of the primeval woods, which are revered and protected by your people. You learn to cast *Longstrider*  spell and can cast it once per short rest, without expending a spell slot. You also learn the *Pass Without Trace* and *Erupting Earth* spells, each of which you can cast once without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to cast these two spells in this way when you finish a long rest. You can also cast the spell using any spell slots you have. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for all three spells.

# Magic and New Spells

### Identifying Magical Items

During a short or a long rest, you can spend time examining an item and try to detect any magical property. As long as the item has a perceptible magical effect and does not require a command to activate it, you learn whether the item is magical or not and the DM may provide hints at the item's properties. The DM may ask for additional skill checks such as Wisdom (Perception or Insight) or Intelligence (Investigation or Arcana) to detect any barely perceptible effects.

During a short or a long rest, any player may attempt to identify a magical item with a proficient Intelligence (Arcana) check. The DC of the check is **15 + half the player level that the item is intended for (rounded up)**. On a failure, you can try again after your next long rest. On a success, you learn the item's magical properties and whether it requires attunement or not. However, if the item has a command such as word or gesture, you do not learn that word or gesture. 

Only the *identify* spell lets you learn the item's properties and how to use them, reveals the command needed to use it, whether it requires attunement to use, and how many spell charges it has, if any, and if the item is cursed.

The table below provides example Arcana DC for magic items of specific rarity based on the level tier they become widely available to players during adventuring.  

##### Identify DC by Magic Item Rarity
| DC  | Rarity |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  15  | Common |
|  17  | Uncommon |
|  19  | Rare |
|  21  | Very Rare |
|  23  | Legendary |

\columnbreak

### Attunement with Magical Items

You can only attune to items that you know their magical properties and that they require attunement, as that knowledge also reveals what kind of ritual is needed to complete that bonds you with the magic item. You can only attune during the one hour of light activity during long rest.

### Hiding Spell Casting

In some situations you may attempt to hide the act of casting spells, cast them in a non-threatening manner, or disguise the use of specific components as part of the spell casting from prying eyes. To cast in a stealthy manner you must make a check for each component the spell has against the highest Passive Perception among all creatures who are actively watching you. Any observer who is proficient in Arcana can make an Intelligence (Arcana) check and choose between the result and its Passive Perception to oppose your checks.

Failure to one check only reveals only suspicious activity unless the observer is proficient in Arcana. Failure to two or more checks reveals unmistakable evidence of casting magic to anyone even if they are not proficient in Arcana.

**If a spell has a Verbal component,** attempt a Intelligence or Wisdom (Stealth) check. Loud background noise (such as a full tavern or a marker crowd) gives you advantage to the your roll. 

**If a spell has a Somatic component,** attempt a Dexterity (Stealth) check. If you benefit from half-cover or there is a lot of nearby movement (such as a moving crowd or passing patrons in a tavern) you get advantage to your roll.

**If a spell has a Material component,** attempt a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand). If you benefit from half-cover (such as sitting at a table in a tavern, with your hands under the table) you get advantage to your roll.

# Animal Companions

___
These rules expand on the concept of animal pets and companions provided by backgrounds, classes and subclasses, or purchased and trained during the course of an adventure. The goal of these rules is to improve the odds of survival of animal companions by introducing hit points and attack progression, and allow adventurers to train companions and animal pets to follow complex commands.

## Pets vs. Companions

Unless your class or subclass grants you with an animal companion with listed abilities that the companion is trained to do, any animal that follows you as part of your background or character concept is a pet. 

Pets are tamed creatures, they recognize you as their master and they respond to the name that you gave them. The pet starts with a number of learned Simple tricks (see Training, pg. 25), and the DM should allow its instincts and abilities to be beneficial to you and spells such as *speak with animals* can allow them to roughly understand simple instructions. Pets will not fight for you until trained to do so, and although they might stand by you in hope you could protect them, they are generally too weak to present any challenge. 

## Taming Animals

If you have proficiency with the Animal Handling skill, you can attempt to tame a creature with Intelligence score of 5 or lower. Creatures with higher Intelligence cannot be tamed. Also creatures with Challenge Rating higher than your level cannot be tamed unless they are friendly towards you and willingly subject themselves to a mutural co-existence. If at any time the animal becomes hostile, a stronger beast would leave or turn against the character. 

Taming a wild creature takes a number of days of downtime or living together equal to the creature's Challenge rating, multiplied by 100. The period cannot be shorter than 50 days. If you or someone else raised the creature from birth, Challenge rating is multiplied by 50 and the period cannot be shorter than 25 days.

Additionally, reduce the time by 10% if you and the creature are both good-aligned, and another 10% if you and the creature are both lawful-aligned. Reduce the time by 10% if you are proficient in Nature, and by another 20% if you have expertise in either Animal Handling or Nature, or you have studied Lore related to that creature. Increase the time by 20% if the creature is evil-aligned, and by another 50% if the creature is chaotic-aligned. 

Once you have tamed a creature, you may spend a downtime with it to teach it new tricks or important commands that it will willingly follow when following you during your adventuring career.

#### Taming Expenses 

For each day during taming a creature, you must provide it with adequate food and water, in volume related to creature's size. The price for food is up to the DM, but below is a reference for common animals.

\columnbreak

##### Creature Needs
| Size | Food | Water
|:---|:--:|:--:|
| Tiny | 1/4 lb. | 1/4 gallon
| Small | 1 lb. | 1 gallon
| Medium | 1 lb. | 1 gallon
| Large | 4 lbs. | 4 gallons
| Huge | 16 lbs. | 12 gallons
| Gargantuan | 48 lbs. | 24 gallons

Animals require different food if they are herbivore or carnivore, or any food if omnivore. Certain unique animals may have highly specialized diets that require imported feed. 

##### Creature Foods
| Food | Price |
|:---|:--:|
| 1 lb. of hay | 1 cp
| 1 lb. of quality wheat | 3 cp
| 1 lb. of meat | 1 sp
| 1 lb. of quality meat | 3 sp
| 1 lb. of rare meat | 1+ gp

You must also care for the creature by keeping it somewhere safe. The larger the creature is or grows to be, the more expensive it is to provide it shelter. 

##### Animal Kennel
| Size | Price |
|:---|:--:|
| Tiny | 5cp/day
| Small | 1sp/day
| Medium | 2sp/day
| Large | 5sp/day
| Huge | 1gp/day
| Gargantuan | 5gp/day

Once a creature has been tamed, it will behave peacefully toward you, your allies and other non-hostile people around them, follow in their general area, and mostly behave itself as much as its personality allows.

### Tamed Endurance

A tamed creature gains 2 hit dice that increase its maximum hit points by twice the size of its Hit dice and two times its Constitution modifier. This represents the experience gained during the weeks it has spent struggling against your will or building relationship with you.

\pagebreakNum

### Training

After you tame a creature, it starts out with number of learned tricks equal to its Intelligence modifier plus 5. For example, a dog with an Intelligence modifier of -3 start with just 2 tricks after being tamed. The tricks are up to player's choice, but they can only be Simple tricks. 

You can spend effort and additional expenses to teach its new pet new Simple or Complex tricks. A creature can know a total number of tricks equal to its Intelligence score (not the modifier). For example, a simple dog can know up to 3 tricks.

Training a new trick to a creature is far simpler and cheaper than taming it in the first place. You need to foot the bill for the creature's food and shelter for number of days equal to 10 minus the creature's Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1). If the trick is a Complex one, multiply that number by 3. For example, a dog would take 7 days to learn a Simple trick and 21 days to learn a new Complex trick.

### Tricks

**Come and Heel (Simple).** This issue is more than just having an creature return when you call it. This command will cause the creature to act against its own desires. The creature will come to you, even if you are standing in a dangerous place. The creature will sit and stay still, even if it really wants to go chase or kill another creature. 

**Attack (Complex).** This command will cause the creature to mercilessly attack whoever you are directing it toward. Teaching the creature this trick also allows them to add a proficiency bonus to their attacks. It is unlikely to relent until the target is ruined, or a come and heel command is given.

**Fetch (Simple).** This command will send the creature to strive to obtain whatever you are directing it toward. If the creature cannot do it, it will attempt to open up any barriers which prevent you from getting it yourself.

**Ride (Simple).** If the creature is at least one size larger than you or able to carry like as it it is one size larger than you, as well as of appropriate anatomy, it can be trained to be a mount. Prior to this training, the creature just acts of its own accord, tolerating your presence on its back. Just because it is trained does not necessarily mean that you know how to ride it though.

**Perform (Simple).** This is one amusing trick your creature does. A back flip on command, playing dead, speaking on command, etc. When used for practical purposes, this is the same as the creature having the Intelligence (Perform) skill.

**Find (Complex).** The creature can use its unique senses to search for things and track or hunt a mark. It is also trained to give a warning call when it spots its mark. The creature must be trained to hunt specific targets (such as humans, or find and follow tracks of blood) to be given a clue followed with a sense that the creature had advantage on Perception checks (such as the smell of your target's clothes, for a wolf).

**Enlighten (Complex).** You spend a great deal of time getting the creature to understand the subtleties of your expression, such that it has a higher understanding of people and what they are talking about. As an example, an unenlightened creature will feel good if you talk to it in a happy tone, even if your words are harsh, but an enlightened creature will get the hint that you're being facetious. This is represented by a one-time +2 Intelligence score improvement for the creature.

\pagebreakNum

**Work (Simple).** The creature can be trained to carry, haul, and tow loads. While you could theoretically strap bags to the side of any creatures, this also applies to things like pulling carts, drawing a line to lift a load by a pulley, or tilling with a plow, which actually do normally require some training to be done well.

**Help (Complex).** Your creature has been trained to remember directions and the locations of important things - like local hospitals, or friendly people. If you are ever injured or lost, you could send your creature to seek help - it will always return to you. creatures trained in this trick will also find their way to you if you are separated.

**Talent (Complex).** This teaches the creature a skill or tool proficiency. It is up to the DM if the proficiency is something the creature can learn or manipulate with its limbs or jaws. For example, using a harp may seem doable for a large rat, but using a kettle drum would not. 

**Deliver (Complex).** You have taught the creature how to navigate its way back to known settlements, and return to you, as well as how to carry and deliver written messages or small parcels.

**Hunt (Complex).** Predatory creatures, such as hawks or dogs, can be taught to hunt on their own and bring the kill back to you, rather than eating it for themselves. This is the same as the creature foraging independently of you.

<div style='margin-top:-2px'></div>

### Complications

Each ten-day week you raise an animal pet or work towards training it, there is a 5 percent chance that your pet will get into a mess and get you involved along with it. The table below lists few examples for inspiration only.

##### Complication Examples
| d8  | Complication |
|:--------------:|:--|
| 1 | You are given an offer to sell your pet. The buyer is a person of power and is not taking no for an answer.
| 2 | Your pet got scared and harmed an obnoxious person. He is now demanding for its death or drive you out.
| 3 | Your pet was wounded by another. It cant train until healed. You have a beef with the other pet's owner.
| 4 | Your pet got confused and scared women or  children. People are wary towards you now. 
| 5 | Your pet uncovered a corpse. You don't know the person but the scene is gruesome. 
| 6 | Your pet's senses alert it of a nearby crime. You have the option to get involved or not. 
| 7 | Your pet's senses have found a lost item or a tiny fortune. You can keep it or track its owner.
| 8 | Your pet has found a mate, and its loyalty to you and primal instincts are conflicting.

## Companions

An animal that is tamed and trained has already increased endurance and the willingness to learn new tricks to appease to its master. However, when your class or subclass provides you with a companion, the bond goes beyond the recognition of you as its master. It is a friendship by equals partners, and the companion feels genuine care about your safety and your

___
goals even if it doesn't fully understand them. This allows the companion to levels up with you and improve its attributes during your adventuring career. 

Companions are considered to be friendly to you and your allies, as well as non-hostile creatures of your or its choice. They are trained in two Simple tricks and automatically come trained in Enlighten trick that increases their Intelligence score by 1. In addition, companions level up as you do and improve their abilities.  

### Companion Advancement

At 3rd level and each odd level after that (5th, 7th, 9th,...), your companion gains an additional hit die that and increases its hit points maximum with the average value of that hit die plus companion's Constitution modifier. The maximum hit dice that a companion can have depend on its size. When the maximum hit dice is met, on each following odd level increase the companion's maximum hit points by its Constitution modifier. 

<div style='margin-top:-2px'></div>

| Companion Size  | Max. Hit Doce |
|:--------------:|:--:|
| Tiny | 5 |
| Small | 7 |
| Medium | 9 |
| Large | 11 |
| Huge | 13 |
| Gargantuan | 15 |

<div style='margin-top:-2px'></div>

At 5th, 9th, 13th and 17th level when you proficiency bonus increases, your companion gains the following benefits:

<div style='margin-top:-10px'></div>

* Choose one of the companion's attributes and increase it by 1. If this changes the attribute modifier, apply the increase to any skills, attack rolls and damage rolls related to that attribute. 
* For each skill that the companion is proficient in, increase its modifier by 1. 
* For each attack that the companion is trained to make, increase its to-hit bonus by 1. 

At 13th level, your companion gains the following legendary benefits:

<div style='margin-top:-10px'></div>

* The companion's size increases to the next larger size category but its maximum hit dice does not change.
* The companion movement speed increases by 5 feet.
* The companion gains two legendary actions, or its legendary actions increase by one if it already has any. It can use its legendary attack to make one attack, to move up to its speed, or to attempt to recharge one ability. 

### Companion Death

When your companion is reduced to 0 hit points, it benefits from the Death saves mechanic in the same way as a player character. 

But if the inevitable moment comes that your companion is dead, there is no ritual and no magical trick to bring it back to life for cheap. Unless spell or ritual exists that the DM has approved, companions are raised back to life in the same way as player characters. Alternatively, you can let go and retain the good memories and eventually find and tame a new animal that the DM allows to convert into companion once tamed and trained in the Enlighten trick.

Coal from that region is associated with stigma of cruel slave labor where captured goblins and kobolds are forced to work under inhumane conditions to mine it. Still, rocks of coal burn twice longer than dry wood and are far more compact than carrying stacks of wood or relying on foraging before camping especially during the arctic winter. <br>A single sack contains enough to maintain 5 campfires.

___
**Cooking pot.** Hot soup is one the the few pleasures that arctic travelers look for by the end of the day.

___

In Icewind Dale, food can be scarce during winters especially long and harsh ones. Prices vary widely depending on town reserves and there's no ceiling price although the authorities of Ten-Towns clamps down on attempts to inflate prices to locals. Strangers however can find themselves at the mercy of merchants. 

### Local Tools of Trade

| Item  | Price | Weight |
|:---|:----:|:-----------:|
|  Engraver's tools  | 25 gp | 2 lbs. |
|  Raw schrimshaw  | 10 gp | 1 lb. |
|  Fisher's supplies  | 20 gp | 6 lbs. |
|  Fishing tackle | 5 gp | 4lb |

___
**Engraver’s tools.** Used for etching designs and words into ivory, metal, stone, and wood. They are the prefered method of creating scrimshaw artworks. A set of engraver’s tools includes several chisels of different sizes, a clamp, 8 ounces of polishing 
fluid, a rag, sandpaper, a stamp, and a hammer.

*Engraving:* As part of a long rest, you can engrave a design into workable material. The design may be filigree, image or a message. Giant runes are also engraved, believed to wield ancient power. Make a Intelligence or Wisdom (Artistry Craft) against the DC of the material used.

| Material Engraved  | DC |
|:---|:----:|:-----------:|
| Wood, ivory, scrimshaw  | 12 | 
| Stone  | 15 | 
| Metal  | 18 | 

*Carving*. You can carve elaborate decorative figurines or items, made of scrimshaw ivory of great value in the South. Choose design complexity from the table below to set the base price per pound of scrimshaw used if the carving is successful. As part of a long rest, you can make one DC 13 Intelligence or Wisdom (Artisty Craft) to work on that figurine. Each time you fail by 5 or more, you leave a noticeable defect and if two defects are made, the figurine is spoiled and has no value for sale. Each time you succeed by 5 or more, you increase the value of your work by 5%. Each critical success raises the value of your work by 20%. 

| Complexity of Carving  | Successes |
|:---|:----:|:-----------:|
| Simple crude, practical form. Base cost 15 gp.  | 2 | 
| Complex figurine. Base cost 40 gp.  | 3 |

>##### The Basics of Crafting
>
>Each trade has its own crafting rules that are very similar to each other. If you want to practice a trade but rules don't exist for it yet, use the following guidelines.
>
>You must be proficient in a Craft or Lore related to that trade. Most trades aslo require a set of tools or special facility such as workshop. Practicing a craft requires making an Intelligence (Craft) check. if the Craft involves a degree of artistry you may use Wisdom instead of Intelligence. You can make one crafting check as part of a long rest, or three crafting checks as part of one day of downtime. 
>
>Each trade may have one or more activities that can be simple or complicated. Simple activity such as repairs requires just one crafting check against DC 12 to 15, depending on the difficulty of the craft. You are allowed to make repairs even if you lack the proficiency int he Craft, but the DC is increased by 2, and failing it by 5 or more causes irreparable damage to the item.  
>
>Complicated activities involve creating something from raw materials, and requires ongoing multiple crafting checks against DC 13 to 16, depending on the difficulty of the craft (usually based on the simple activity DC, increased by +1 or +2, up to DM). If you fail on a check you waste the time and make any progress, but if you also failed by 5 or more you cause a defect to the item you are working on. If you succeed on the check you make one success towards your progress, and if you succeed by 5 or more you also improve the design increasing the selling price of the item by 5%. Any critical success on a crafting check improves the selling price of the item by 20% instead of 5%, and removes one defect from the item. In order to complete the item you are working on, you must get 2 to 7 successes before you make two defects at the item at which point it is flawed and loses its selling value. 
>
>If you roll natural 1 on a crafting check, you damage your crafting tools and further checks cannot be made with it until you spend gold equal to one fifth of the tool price to resupply the broken equipment. 
>
>The minimum profit you can make on the item you create depends on the base cost of all materials needed and the number of successes that the item needs before accumulating two defects. Depending on the demand of the item the values can be further increased, even exponentially so for items requiring high level of artistry. Remember that these profits are not automatic or guaranteed and you must find a market for it, such as a trader to buy the crafted goods from you and sell them at a markup price. 
> 
> | Base cost multiplier  | Successes |
> |:---|:----:|:-----------:|
> | Simple item. Multiplier x1.2  | 2 |

When chewed and put into the mouth of an unconscious or sleeping creature, the berries juice stimulate their senses and bring them to consciousness. They can also cure hangovers and stomach ache.

**Kanishta Root.** Chewing on an ounce of the bitter, dry kanishta root staves off the effects of extreme cold. Once consumed, for the next hour you don't have to roll Constitution saving throws to resist gaining a level of Exhaustion or falling asleep and freezing to death, unless you are naked or wet. Prolonged consumption of the root is addictive (DC 14 to resist). People who rely on kanishta root to endure the elements can be recognized by their green-yellow teeth. Withdrawal symptoms occur in 1d4 days of no consumption and include depression, blurred vision and loss of smell and taste. Long-term use causes deterioration of the liver, stomach and colon.

___
**Kanishta Root, Powdered.** Desperation forces the poor folk to snort powder from already cherwed root spittle, driend and ground to dust. Once snorted, for the next hour you gain advantage to Constitution saving throws to resist gaining a level of Exhaustion or falling asleep and freezing to death, unless you are naked or wet. Kanishta root powder is even more addictive (DC 16 to resist) and long-term use damages the brain, causing hallucination and loss of memory.

**Sled dogs.** Select breeds such as Heteff (similar to Siberian Huskies), Okteff (similar to Alaskan Malamute) and Moorhounds (similar to Tibetan Mastiffs) make perfect sled dogs. Their puppies are sold at a premium especially if pure-bred. Every snow sled needs a number of trained dogs to fill its swing, point and wheel positions, as well as one or two leaders depending on where it is a one-lead (with up to 4 dogs) or two lead (up to 12 dogs)

### Vehicles

Vehicles have the following additional properties:
* **Crew:** The minimum number of creatures that are piloting the vehicle at all times.
* **Passengers:** Additional number of creatures that can safely use the vehicle for transportation.
* **Cargo** The total weight that the vehicle can carry safely, excluding the weight of the crew and the passengers but including their belongings. If the amount is exceeded, the vehicle suffers a -1 mile/hour to speed, all maneuvers checks are made at disadvantage, and the creatures (usually mounts) that pull the vehicle suffer an additional level of exhaustion at the end of a day of work. If the total weight exceeds double the Cargo limit, the vehicle suffers a -2 miles/hour to speed, and a failure on a maneuver check leads to the vehicle breaking or the cargo spilling (up to DM). Mounts that pull the vehicle suffer an additional level of exhaustion at the end of a travel leg (4 hours of work). 
* **Damage Threshold** Any damage that deals less than the Damage Threshold of the vehicle, deals no damage to it. 

___
__Dogsled.__ Dogsleds vary in size, from personal sleds used to travel between towns or in sled competitions, to boat-sized wagons meant to transport large amount of provisions. A dog sled can be pulled by any adult dogs, but unless half or more of the dogs are trained, the sled suffers disadvantage to all maneuver checks. For each row, at least one dog must be a leader or the sled is impossible to control. Dog sleds provide no protection from cold or extreme cold weather. Dog sleds ignore difficult and greater difficult terrain in snow and ice, and its passengers only suffer the Unstable condition (see pg. 11) while the snow sled moves in greater difficult terrain. 

___
__Wagons__ Wagons used in the arctic tundra are preferred because they offer closed interior that provides immunity to cold and extreme cold weather. Sleeper wagons are larger and half of its compartment is repurposed for sleeping bunks for its passengers. Mounts are usually draft horses, reindeer or thunderbeasts.

# Travel

___
Wilderness travel through the howling reaches of the tundra is a dangerous activity that will not only take time but also exhaust your resource and require planning and cooperation to do safely. These rules simulate the resource management and perils of day to day traveling.

Players must appoint one dependable player with the role of Travel Manager, who will keep track of these rules, manage the use of resources and distribute tasks between players.

<div style='margin-top:-2px;'></div>

## The Travel Day

During each travel day, the players must make choices.

**Choose Destination and Speed.** Players must choose a travel pace (fast, normal or slow) and whether they will force march despite exhaustion. The DM determines the distance crossed based on terrain and climate conditions and how close they are to their destination.

**Decide Travel Activities.** The players distribute Travel Activities among themselves. In each of the two travel legs of the daily routine, a player may take one activity of his choice. Some activities allow several players to work as a group.

**Making Camp.** After each two travel legs, the players must search the environment and find a proper location for setting up camp. Depending on the location, the camp may have different properties. 

**Decide Camp Activities.** The players distribute Camp Activities among themselves. Each player can take one Camp Activity before having to rest for the night. 

\columnbreak


A typical day of travel consists of roughly 9 to 12 hours of activity, out of which there are 6-10 hours of actual travel. Each half of the travel day is called a travel leg. At specific times the party must rest, drink and eat.

##### Daily Travel Routine
| Activity | Time | Cost |
|:------:|:-------:|:-------:|
|Wake up in the morning|——|——|
|Breakfast and breaking up camp|——|1/2 ration|
|First travel leg|3-5 hours| 2 pints water|
|Midday break|1-2 hours| 1/2 ration |
|Second travel leg|3-5 hours| 2 pints water|
|Long Rest for the night|8 hours|——| 

#### Daylight by Season
During summer and winter in the arctic tundra, roughly 30 to 45 days there is permanent daylight or night. 

| Season | Sunrise | Sunset | Time Traveling |
|:------:|:-------:|:------:|:--------:|
| Summer |  2 am   | 10 pm  | 10 hours |
| Spring/Autumn |  5 am   | 7 pm  | 8 hours |
| Winter |  10 pm  | 2 am  |  6 hours |

\pagebreakNum

## Travel Speed

The typical marching speed of a humanoid in **3 miles per hour**, or a total of 24 miles during a 8-hour travel day. 

If you ride mounts such as horses during summer or dog sleds during winter the travel speed increases to **5 miles per hour**, or 40 miles daily total. The DM may change the speed based on the breed of the mount. If your mount is carrying or pulling cart or sled with more than half its maximum capacity, decrease the speed by hour by 1 mile.

##### Travel Pace

You may choose between fast, normal and slow pace. Your chosen pace of travel changes your speed and affects how easy it is to do things during your daily travel legs. 

**Fast Pace**. Your travel speed increases by 1 mile per hour, or 2 miles if you ride a mount. You or your mount suffers one extra level of exhaustion at the end of each travel leg. You cannot use fast pace through difficult terrain or if terrain's Navigation DC is 15 or higher.

**Slow Pace**. Your travel speed decreases by 1 mile per hour. You benefit from advantage to Keep Watch, Navigate, Scout and Track activities. 

##### Travel Activities

Your chosen pace of travel affects how easy it is to do things during your daily travel legs. 

**Favored Activities.** Favored activities may be made with advantage when traveling at this pace.

**Associated Activities.** Associated activities are typical activities for the corresponding pace.

**Hindered Activities.** Hindered activities must be made with disadvantage when traveling at this pace.

**Forbidden Activities.** These activities cannot be taken when traveling at this pace.

##### Forced March

Players can safely travel for 8 hours in a day before risking exhaustion. For each additional hour of travel beyond that, each player or their mounts must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of every hour. The DC is **10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours**. On a failed saving throw, the player or its mount suffers a level of exhaustion and may have to roll against Ignore DC to continue to march willingly. 

If the party is moving at a *slow* pace, they gain a +5 bonus to the check, and a *fast* pace imposes a disadvantage to the check.

\columnbreak 



<div style='margin-top:-5px;'></div>

## Terrain
Several activities during travel refer to the Navigation DC. This DC is dependent on the terrain you are traversing.

The harder the terrain, the slower your group will advance during your travel, up to a point where you must concentrate on actually moving, rather than paying attention to other activities. If difficult terrain slows your pace to 0 miles or less, you can still move but at ½ a mile per hour. 


<div style='margin-top:5px;'></div>

<div class="smalltab">

| Terrain Difficulty                                 | DC | Speed Modifier |
|:------------------------------------------------------|:--:|:------------------:|
|Tundra, Lively|8|——
|Tundra, Snow-Covered|12|-1 mile/hour
|Mountain, low or medium|13|-2 miles/hour
|Forest, light or medium|13|-1 mile/hour
|Forest, heavy|14|-2 miles/hour
|Glacier, frozen lakes or rivers|16|-2 mile/hour
|Mountain, high|18|-3 miles/hour

In addition the following terrain properties and climate modify your Navigation DC and travel speed. If the travel speed has two values, the second one is applied to fast pace.

| Terrain Modifiers                                 | DC | Speed Modifier |
|:------------------------------------------------------|:--:|:------------------:|
|Any terrain, travel by trail|-3|–/+1 mile/hour
|Any terrain, travel by road|-5|+1/+2 miles/hour
|Heavy snowfall, lightly onscured|+3|-1 mile/hour
|Blizard, heavy obscured|+5|-2 miles/hour


</div>

## Travel Activities

For each travel leg, players may choose one of the following activities in accordance with your chosen travel pace. Each activity has an associated Skills or Lores you need to use to determine your success or failure during the travel leg. Activities are also marked with special icons described below.

##### Dangerous Activities <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/20/000000/poison-filled.png">
Several activities are noted as *Dangerous*. Performing one of these activities usually means having to separate from the group with a risk of being attacked or trapped without help.

##### Distracting Activities <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/20/000000/watch-your-step-filled.png">
Some activities are so demanding that you can't pay much attention to your surroundings. If you perform a *Distracting* activity, you suffer a -5 penalty to your Passive Wisdom (Perception) score for the whole travel leg.

##### Exhausting Activities <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/20/000000/napping-filled.png">
Some activities are much more tiresome that simple travel. If you perform more than one *Exhausting* activity during the same day, you suffer one level of Exhaustion and cannot perform any more *Exhausting* activities.

##### Focused activities <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/20/000000/west-direction-filled.png">
Most activities can be performed by any number of players. However, the *Focused* activities can only be performed by a maximum of 2 players, and you only use the higher of the two check results to determine their effect. 

### Draw a Map <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/20/58180d/watch-your-step-filled.png"> <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/20/58180d/west-direction-filled.png">
___
**Skill:** proficient Intelligence (Survival) or Caligraphy and Mapmaking Craft
___
While your companions keep watch, hunt for food and guide the party, you focus on documenting your journey. Drawing a map won't help you on your journey forward, but might prove useful once you try to find your way back. Good maps are also a highly sought-after commodity.

___
Make a check against the Navigation DC.

<div style='margin-top:-9px;'></div>

* If your guide succeeded on their Navigation check, you gain a +5 bonus to your check.
* If they failed by less than 5, you suffer a -5 penalty.
* If you got lost, your check automatically fails.
* For each travel leg, note if you succeeded or failed your cartography check.

Once you have reached your destination, divide the number of successful cartography checks by the total number of legs travelled, and compare the result on the following table:

| Success per Travel Leg  | Result |
|:--------------------------------------:|:-------|
| ~ 0.75 |  Detailed Map    |
| ~ 0.5  |  Simple Map      |
| ~ 0.25 |  Crude Map       |
|  < 0.25   |  *Wasted Effort* |

### Hunt & Forage  <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/20/58180d/poison-filled.png">
___
**Skill:** proficient Wisdom (Survival) or Hunting Lore

___
During your travels, you keep an eye out for nearby sources of food such as hunting small game or finding editable roots and vegetation. Make a check and compare the result with the tundra season on the following table to determine the number of fresh rations (for 1 day) you manage to provide.

Hunt and Foraging on the go is not the same as Hunting. Hunting for big game that provides many more rations is its own set of rules explained at the end of this chapter.

### Keep Watch
___
**Skill:** Wisdom (Perception)

___
You keep your eyes peeled and your ears open for any sign of approaching danger, as well as signs of close by pursuers. The DM determines the Stealth result of any threat or the DC to notice other suspicious activity along your path and compares it to the result of all watching players. 

### Navigate <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/20/58180d/watch-your-step-filled.png"> <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/20/58180d/west-direction-filled.png">
___
**Skill:** proficient Wisdom (Survival) or Navigation or Tundra Geography Lore

___
More often than not, a location of interest for a group of adventurers is not situated along a well trodden path, but hidden in the wilds behind obscure hints and directions.

If you wish to find your way through the wilds towards a specific location, you need to make a Navigation check at the Navigation DC of the terrain you want to pass through, or the DC set by the DM if the location is of unknown location. The Navigation DC is additionally modified by the information you possess to reach your destination:

<div style='margin-top:-7px'></div>

| Detail of information | DC |
|:----------------------|:---------------------------------------:|
| Detailed map with exact travel hints                             | -5 |
| Simple map, as long as not very outdated                                     |  -2 |
| Crude Map or general directions *(e.g. 40 <br>   miles north-west, near a small lake)* |  +2 or more  |
| Obscure information *(e.g. follow the <br>  rising sun for 2 moons as the owl flies)*  | +5 or more |

<div style='margin-top:-7px'></div>

If your navigation check fails by less than 5, you roughly travel towards your target, but not in the most direct way. Your travel distance towards your destination is halved (rounded down) for this travel leg.

If your navigation check fails by 5 or more, you got lost and make no progress. Depending on the nature of your surroundings, getting lost might entail additional complications and dangers.



### Scout <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/20/58180d/poison-filled.png"> <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/20/58180d/west-direction-filled.png"> <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/20/58180d/napping-filled.png">
___
**Skill:** proficient Intelligence (Investigation) in civil environment, proficient Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Survival) in wild environment, or Scouting Lore.

___
If your travel information is rather vague, or you are simply curious to see what else there is to see, you can scout ahead of the group. Make a. If you are approaching stealthily, also make a Dexterity (Stealth) check but you travel at half your speed. The DM determines the DC for any noticeable things in the vicinity and whether you are noticed scouting.

You might find such things as creatures waiting in ambush, favorable paths, or hidden locations.

\pagebreakNum

<div style='margin-top:20px'></div>

### Sneak <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/20/58180d/watch-your-step-filled.png">

**Skill:** proficient Dexterity (Stealth) or Disguise and Camoufaging Craft

___
Sometimes you need to move quietly for a while to avert the eyes and ears of nearby enemies or to cover your tracks and take detours to shake off possible pursuers. The DM sets the check DC or the Scouting result of any hostile creatures.

Every player who can perform the Sneak activity makes the check against the DC or Scouting result. On a success, the player earns one sneak point for the party. On a critical success or beating the DC by 5 points or more, the player earns two sneak points for the party. 

To successfully sneak or lose your pursuers, the party must gather sneak points equal to half the number of players in the party (rounded up). On a successful sneak, the party can also try to cover its tracks by selecting one player who makes a Wisdom (Survival) check. The result is the Sneak DC against any attempt by pursuers to track you down. 

### Track <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/20/58180d/west-direction-filled.png">
___
**Skill:** proficient Wisdom (Survival) or Scouting  Lore

___
Sometimes you don't try to find a specific location, but follow or chase another creature or group. Instead of the Navigation activity, make a Wisdom (Survival) check against the terrain DC to find and follow the tracks of your quarry. If your quarry is trying to cover their tracks, use the higher of their Sneak result or the terrain DC.

If your check fails by less than 5, you are having trouble following your quarry. Your travel speed is halved (rounded down) for this travel leg.

If your check fails by 5 or more, you have made a mistake. Your travel speed is halved (rounded down) for this travel leg, however, you moved away from your quarry.

If you rolled a total of 5 or lower, you got lost. Depending on the nature of your surroundings, getting lost might entail additional complications and dangers.

___
A different use for the Track activity is to read the tracks your group crosses during their travel, in order to glean what kind of creatures are roaming nearby. Make a Wisdom (Survival) check. The DM determines the DC for any possible tracks you might find and to which creatures they might belong.

## Perils of Travel

### Weather

There are two distinct arctic conditions that imperil the travel - cold and extreme cold weather. 

Clothes and equipment that only provide resistance to a weather condition convert it to the milder version. For example, a furred coat provides resistance to extreme cold and will make extreme cold weather feel as cold weather but will not completely remove extreme cold effect. Equipment or magical effects that provide immunity to a weather condition protect completely from it and its milder version, if any.

Resistance to cold damage does not grant resistance to cold weather, but immunity to cold damage does make you immune to cold weather.

##### Cold

Whenever the temperature at at or below -10° Celsius, a creature exposed to the cold without resistance or immunity to cold damage finds it difficult to rest in one place. It cannot recover exhaustion during short rest. At the end of the long rest it only recovers hit points equal to half its maximum hit points rather than all its hit points, unless it benefits from comfortable camp location (such as a mountain lee or a cave).

A naked or wet creature that lacks resistance or immunity to cold weather is instead exposed to extreme cold effect until clothed or dried and warmed.

##### Extreme Cold

Whenever the temperature is at or below -30° Celsius, a creature exposed to the cold must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour or gain one level of exhaustion and must roll against Ignore DC to continue their physical activity. Te DM may increase the DC to 12 or higher if the extreme cold is caused by magical or supernatural means. Creatures naturally adapted to extreme cold weather or with resistance to cold damage roll with advantage. Creatures immune to cold damage automatically succeed on the saving throw. 

Creatures without resistance or immunity to cold damage find it impossible to recover under extreme cold conditions and are lured into falling asleep. You cannot spend hit dice during short rest, and during long rest you must make a Constitution saving throw against **DC 10 + 1 for each level of Exhaustion** you have to avoid falling asleep. If you fail the roll, you start to slowly lose consciousness freezing to death. At the end of every hour, repeat the same Constitution saving throw. Failure on each repeated check causes you to take 2d6 cold damage, and your maximum hit points decreases with the same amount. If yout hit point maximum reaches 0, you freeze to death. If you succeed, you are awaken. You only need to make physical activity for an hour to recover your lost hit point maximum, but not your lost hit points.

### Terrain

There are variety of terrain complications in the tundra, but this section will cover only the most common ones. 

##### Thick Snow

Any snow-covered terrain with snow thickness over one foot is considered difficult terrain during combat encounters. If the snow thickness is over three feet, the terrain is greater difficult terrain (15 feet of movement is spent to move across 5 feet of terrain). 

##### Slippery Ice

Slippery ice is difficult terrain. When a creature moves onto slippery ice for the first time on a turn, it must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or fall prone. A creature can ignore the difficult terrain property of ice, but then the DC is increased to 15 (or more, up to DM).

##### Thin Ice

Thin ice has a weight tolerance of 3d10 × 10 pounds per 10-foot-square area. Whenever the total weight on an area of thin ice exceeds its tolerance, the ice in that area breaks. All creatures on broken ice fall through.

\columnbreak

##### Heavy Snowfall

Heavy snowfall imposes disadvantage on ranged weapon attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on seeing. Anything past 20 feet is lightly obscured and as if behind half-cover, and anything past 40 feet is heavily obscured (but still noticeable as a faint silhouette) and as if behind three-quarters cover. Any tracks made during heavy snowfall benefit from DC 12 if older than 10 minutes, DC 15 if older than one hour, or DC 20 if older than 8 hours. 

##### Strong Wind

A strong wind imposes disadvantage on ranged weapon attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing. A strong wind also extinguishes open flames, disperses fog, and makes flying by nonmagical means nearly impossible. A flying creature in a strong wind must land at the end of its turn or fall. A strong wind in arctic tundra can create a snowstorm that imposes the same effect as Heavy Snowfall. 

##### Frigid Water

A creature can be immersed in frigid water for a number of minutes equal to its Constitution score before suffering any ill effects. Each additional minute spent in frigid water counts as one hour exposed in extreme cold weather. Even if the creature is removed from frigid water, it remains wet for 2d6 minutes unless administered proficient first aid help and new set of clothes which halves the time (or negates the extreme cold condition, up to DM). The creature keeps suffering by the extreme cold condition until it is fully dry.  

##### High Altitude

Traveling at altitudes of 10,000 feet or higher above sea level is taxing for a creature that needs to breathe, because of the reduced amount of oxygen in the air. Each hour such a creature spends traveling at high altitude counts as 2 hours for the purpose of determining how long that creature can travel (up to 8 hours per day, unless using forced march).

Breathing creatures can become acclimated to a high altitude by spending 30 days or more at this elevation. Breathing creatures can't become acclimated to elevations above 20,000 feet unless they are native to the environment.

## Hazards

No adventuring party is safe from hazards such as blizzards, hailstorms, avalanches and earthquakes. Pick the appropriate tier of your player group and the danger level of the hazard: setback, dangerous or deadly. Each hazard has a saving throw ( Dexterity or Constitution) that the players must make. 

If they fail, they take damage appropriate for their level tier. If they succeed, they take half of that damage. If they critically fail, they suffer vulnerability to the full damage. If they critically succeed, they have resistance to the half damage. 


##### Hazards Save DCs and Attack Bonuses
| Hazard Danger Level | Save DC |
|:----|:---|
| Setback | 10-11 |
| Dangerous | 12-15 |
| Deadly | 16-20 |

\pagebreakNum

##### Damage Severity by Level
| Character Level | Setback | Dangerous | Deadly |
|:----:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 1st-4th | 1d10 | 2d10 | 4d10 |
| 5th-10th | 2d10 | 4d10 | 10d10 |
| 11th-16th | 4d10 | 10d10 | 18d10 |
| 17th-20th | 10d10 | 18d10 | 24d10 |

##### Avalanches and Rockfalls
*Any Level of Hazard*
___
Any character in the area where the hazard occurs must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes bludgeoning damage and is buried by the hazard, or half as much damage on a successful one and is not buried. The area is filled with snow, ice and rubble.

Any buried creature is considered suffocated, and it can dig through to free itself. To do so, the creature must succeed a number of Strength (Athletics) checks, as shown in the following table.

| Hazard Level | Number of Checks |
|:----|:----:|
| Setback  | 2 |
| Dangerous  | 3 |
| Deadly | 4 |

You can read more about suffocating rules in chapter 8 of the *Player's Handbook.*

##### Blizzard or Hailstorm
*Setback Hazard (Blizzard), Dangerous Hazard (Hailstorm)*
___
The area affected by a blizzard is considered difficult terrain, or if it is difficult terrain already it becomes greater difficult terrain (15 feet of movement is spent to move across 5 feet of terrain). It also becomes affected from the Strong Wind weather condition.

When a creature without proper shelter is in the area affected by the blizzard for one hour or more, it must make a Constitution saving throw, taking cold damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. If a creature is wearing clothing that provide resistance to cold or extreme weather, it has advantage on the saving throw.

Hailstorm are similar to Blizzard but instead every hour, the check must be made every 30 minutes and clothing that provide resistance to cold or extreme weather, do not provide advantage against hailstorms.

##### Earthquakes
*Any Level of Hazard*
___
A powerful tremor shakes the area; each creature on the ground in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone. If the creature is on ice, it cracks or shatters if thin. The hazard level is determined by the proximity to the epicentre or the intensity of the earth tremor:
- **Setback.** Far from the epicentre or light earthquake.
- **Dangerous.** Near the epicentre or moderate earthquake.
- **Deadly.** Very close to the epicentre or severe earthquake.

## Making Camp <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/20/58180d/west-direction-filled.png"> 

**Skill:** proficient Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Survival), or Hunting or Scouting Lore

___
When it's time to make camp for the night, the players need to start looking for a suitable camping location. Up to two players can spend up to an hour of time and make the check. If you had players *Scout* on the last leg, they can use their Intelligence (Investigation) check result instead their Making Camp check. Depending on the best result the campsite has one or more randomly selected properties.

<div style='column-count:2'>

| Campsite properties | Search Result |
|:-------------------:|:---------:|
| 0 |  1–8 |
| +1st Property | 9–11 |
| +2nd Property | 12–15 |

| Campsite properties | Search Result |
|:-------------------:|:---------:|
| +3rd Property | 16–20 |
| Improve 1st | 21–25 |
| Improve 2nd | 26+ |

</div>

The DM rolls a d6 on the table below to decide what campsite properties are found first, second and third.

<div style='margin-top:-3px;'></div>

| d6 | 1st Property | 2nd Property | 3rd Property |
|:-------------------:|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|
|1|Comfortable|Defendable|Hidden
|2|Comfortable|Hidden|Defendable
|3|Defendable|Comfortable|Hidden
|4|Defendable|Hidden|Comfortable
|5|Hidden|Comfortable|Defendable
|6|Hidden|Defendable|Comfortable

<div style='margin-top:-3px;'></div>

___
If you are not content with the campsites you found, you must travel on for another hour (risking a forced march), in order to search again. Once night sets in, all Making Camp checks are made at disadvantage.

<div style='margin-top:-3px;'></div>

##### Comfortable
*The campsite is reasonably protected against all but the harshest weather.* You ignore the effect of cold weather, and extreme cold weather affects you as if it were cold weather. You ignore the effect of climate conditions such as strong wind, heavy snowfall, blizzard and hailstorm. Comofrtable camp allows to lit and maintain a campfire during long rest.

<div style='margin-top:-3px;'></div>

##### Defendable
*The campsite has a natural barrier or is otherwise difficult to reach (e.g. inside the canopy of a large tree or up on a rock ledge).* The party entering the camp for the first time and other approaching creatures need to succeed on a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check to enter the camp.

This property can be improved on a Search Result of 20 and more, increasing the DC to enter the campsite to 20.

<div style='margin-top:-3px;'></div>

##### Hidden
*The campsite is removed or obscured from prying eyes (e.g. a cave behind a waterfall or under the leaves of a huge willow tree).* Approaching creatures need to succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check to find your camp.

This property can be improved on a Search Result of 20 or more, increasing the DC to find the campsite to 20.

\pagebreakNum

## Camp Activities

Once a party sets down to rest, players can choose one or more of the following activities. Each activity takes roughly 1 hour, and each player can perform one of these activities during a short rest, or two activities during a typical long rest of 8 hours (6 hours of sleep and 2 hours of light activity).

You may always expend hit dice to regain lost hit points, but you can take a special camp activity to accelerate your recovery (*Tend to the Wounded*).

<div style='margin-top:px'></div>

### Camouflage Camp <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/20/58180d/watch-your-step-filled.png"> <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/20/58180d/west-direction-filled.png">
___
**Skill:** Dexterity (Stealth)

___
You can gather and use natural materials like rocks or foliage to hide your campsite. A successful DC 15 Dexterity (Stealth) check adds the *Hidden* property to your campsite if it doesn't have it. The DM may increase the DC of the check due to terrain or climate complications.

<div style='margin-top:px'></div>

### Cook Hearty Meal <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/20/58180d/watch-your-step-filled.png"> <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/20/58180d/west-direction-filled.png">
___
**Skill:** Cooking and Brewing Craft, Comfortable camp

___
A good night's rest is not guaranteed when camping in the wilds and a fine cooked meal can go a long way to remedy this fact. Make a DC 15 Wisdom (Cook's utensils) check. <br>You need one fresh ration of food for every person that will partake of the meal, as well as a reasonable amount of seasoning. If you provide at least 20% more fresh rations than necessary (rounded up), you gain advantage on this check. If you can only provide half the required amount of rations (but not less), you gain disadvantage.

\columnbreak

If you succeed, each person partaking of your meal gains 3 temporary hit points per each point of their proficiency bonus (6 temp hp if proficiency +2, 9 temp hp if proficiency +3, and so on). The temporary hit points last for 24 hours. If you fail, the meal is edible, but not refreshing. If you rolled a total of 5 or lower, the whole meal is spoiled and its rations are wasted.

You can only benefit from one hearty meal per long rest.

<div style='margin-top:px'></div>

### Fortify Camp <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/20/58180d/watch-your-step-filled.png"> <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/20/58180d/west-direction-filled.png">
___
**Skill:** Strength (Athletics)

___
You can use wooden spikes or large boulders to barricade your campsite or dig a ditch and build ramparts. A successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check adds the *Defendable* property to your campsite if it doesn't already have it. The DM may increase the DC of the check due to terrain or climate complications.

<div style='margin-top:px'></div>

### Hunt & Forage <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/20/58180d/poison-filled.png">
___
**Skill:** Wisdom (Survival) 

___
Gather food and water or hunt local game.  This is the same action as the *Hunt & Forage* travel activity. However, since you are not traveling at this point but you have very limited time before sunset, you may make the corresponding Wisdom (Survival) check with advantage but the number of rations found are decreased by 1. If you choose not to rest but hunt all night, you ignore the decrease in ration number.

\pagebreakNum

### Keep Watch
___
**Skill:** Wisdom (Perception) or Scouting Lore

___
A long rest requires at least 6 hours of sleep and 2 hours of light activity. Depending on the size of the traveling party, you are advised to take shifts keeping watch whilst the others try to gain some sleep. Make a Wisdom (Perception) check. If your result is 5 or lower, you can take 6 instead. Players who perform one of the other camp activities (i.e. not sleeping or keeping watch) do not benefit from a minimum of 8 on the roll.

The DM determines the DC for any threat or approaching danger (hostile creatures or natural phenomena) and compares it to all Wisdom (Perception) results. On a success, the watchers are able to wake and warn the rest of the party, and prevent being surprised.

<div style='margin-top:-3px'></div>

### Set up Traps <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/20/58180d/watch-your-step-filled.png"> <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/20/58180d/west-direction-filled.png">
___
**Skill:** Wisdom (Survival)

___
You can set a number of small traps like caltrops, slings, and small pits around your camp. Make a Wisdom (Survival) check. The DC to find these traps with an Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check, as well as the DC for any saving throw made to resist their effects is equal to the result of your Wisdom (Survival) check. These traps do 2d4 damage if triggered and enough noise for guards to hear them, or sleeping creatures to attempt Constitution saving throws to be alarmed and awakened.

<div style='margin-top:-3px'></div>

### Talk to The Group <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/20/58180d/watch-your-step-filled.png"> <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/20/58180d/west-direction-filled.png">
___
**Skill:** proficient Charisma (Deception or Persuasion), a camp with Comfortable and one additional property

___
You gather your allies around the campfire and encourage them with your determination and leadership, sharing stories of the past or discussing the plan ahead. The DM sets a DC based on on the situation you and your allies find themselves in, and the stress level of your allies. If you succeed, at the end of the long rest each ally recovers one additional hit die. 

If you beat the DC by 5 or more, you also grant each ally a determination die that is d4. Until the start of the next long rest, that die can be rolled and added to any skill check that would otherwise fail, making it potentially succeed. 

| DC | Examples |
|:----|:---|
| 15 | Prepare yourselves for a challenge ahead. |
| 20 | Times a hard, and sacrifice are required. |
| 25 | All has failed, and a certain deaths awaits us all. |

<div style='margin-top:-3px'></div>

### Tend to the Weary <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/20/58180d/watch-your-step-filled.png">
___
**Skill:** proficient Wisdom (Medicine), a Comfortable camp
___
You go around camp, making sure that the wounds and condition of up to six creatures other than yourself have taken all precautions against extreme weather. For each ally, spend a use of healer's kit and make a check against DC 15.

At the end of the long rest, every tended creature that removed level of Exhaustion during its long rest and still has three or more levels of Exhaustion, removes an additional level of Exhaustion. 

## Optional Mounted Travel

The basic travel rules already cover travel by foot and mounts. However, these optional rules provide more variety and depth to travel by mounts and mounted vehicles.

The table below contains various mount animals native to the tundra, each with their standard cost, weight capacity and slightly modified travel leg distance. If you want to add mount variety to your game, use that travel leg distance as base rather than calculating mount speed per hour. 

| Pace | Cost | Travel Leg Distamce| Capacity
|:------|:---------------|:------:|:----:|----:|
| Musk Ox | 30 gp |16 miles| 700 lb
| Giant Boar| 400 gp |17 miles| 300 lb
| Donkey | 8 gp |  17 miles| 420 lb
| Riding Horse| 75 gp | 20 miles| 480 lb
| War Horse| 400 gp | 22 miles| 540 lb
| Draft Horse | 50 gp | 18 miles| 540 lb
| Mammoth | 700 gp | 18 miles| 1500 lb
| Carriage | 100 gp | 16 miles| 1500 lb
| Cart, wagon | 15 gp | 18 miles| 480 lb


Animals need feed (per day) or can find some themselves with a Wisdom (Survival) check at a DC based on the *Hunt & Forage* table for 1 Ration. Animals who hunger or thirst for longer than 2 days suffer one level of Exhaustion per day at the end of their long rest. 

| Feed Type | Cost | Weight 
|:------|:---------------|:------|
| Herbivores (hay, barley) | 5cp | 10 lb.| 
| Omnivore (disposed food) | 10cp | 5 lb.| 
| Carnivore (by-products, entrails) | 25cp | 3 lb.| 

Mounts can pull five times their typical carrying capacity minus the weight of the vehicle. Mounts pulling carts or wearing armor may not travel more than two travel legs in a row without rest and suffer a disadvantage to the Forced March check. Travel groups that use wagons have access to the Drive Wagon travel activity, below.

### Drive Vehicle <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/20/58180d/watch-your-step-filled.png"> <img src="https://img.icons8.com/ios/20/58180d/west-direction-filled.png">
___
**Skill:** proficient Dexterity (Animal Handling) skill or Farming Lore, or Sled Vehicle Building or Sled Animal Breeding if the vehicle is a snow sled.
___
You stay at the front of the vehicle, maintaining a steady pace for the animals and avoiding road obstacles that slow down or damage the carriage. Make the check against Navigation DC. Increase the DC by 5 if you are traveling off-road, without a clear trail or road. 

If your check succeeds by 5 or more, you may increase the travel pace by 1 mile per hour for the rest of the travel leg.

If your check fails by 10 or more or is a critical failure, the vehicle breaks. Repairing it is a Focused activity requiring a successful DC 15 Intelligence or Craft check related to repair or building that kind of vehicle and takes a full travel leg.

# Blizzard Travel

___
**Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden**, pg. 10-11
___
The blizzards that ravage Icewind Dale and harry travelers on the mountain pass are reflections of Auril’s self- imposed isolation. A blizzard in Icewind Dale typically lasts 2d4 hours, and whenever the characters are caught in one, the following rules apply until the blizzard ends.

The blizzard’s howling wind limits hearing to a range of 100 feet and imposes disadvantage on ranged weapon attack rolls. It also imposes disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing. The wind extinguishes open flames, disperses fog, erases tracks in the snow, and makes flying by nonmagical means nearly impossible. A flying creature in the wind must land at the end of its next turn or fall.

Visibility in the blizzard is reduced to 30 feet. Creatures without goggles or other eye protection have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight due to blowing snow.

Any creature that is concentrating on a spell during combat in the blizzard must, at the end of its turn, succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or lose its concentration on the spell unless the creature is sheltered against the elements (for example, in an igloo).

\columnbreak

##### Blizzards on the Open Tundra 

On the open tundra, it’s easy to veer off course while traveling through a blizzard, and it’s also easy for party members to become separated from one another, which is why the wisest course of action is to stay put and wait for the blizzard to pass.

If the characters travel during a blizzard, have the players designate one party member as the navigator. At the start of the blizzard, the DM makes a DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check on behalf of the navigator. On a successful check, the party stays on course. On a failed check, the party wanders off course, putting its members no closer to their destination than they were when the blizzard started.

If the check fails by 5 or more and the party members aren’t tied together, one randomly determined party member becomes lost in the blizzard and separated from the others at a time of the DM’s choosing. When the blizzard passes, have the characters (including the missing one) make a DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) group check at the end of each hour. If this group check succeeds, the missing party member is found, but no progress is made reaching the group’s intended destination. The group check can be repeated after each hour spent searching for the missing party member.

# Hunting

___
Hunting is the practice of seeking, pursuing, and capturing or killing wild animals. Hunting wildlife or feral animals is most commonly done for the gathering of raw materials and meat in order to sustain oneself or for trade.

The process of Hunting consists of three stages. 

* **Locate.** Use your Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Survival) skill to locate animals in your surrounding <br>area. On success, will locate one or several hunting opportunities. 
* **Track.** Use your Wisdom (Survival or Perception) skill to follow the tracks of animals to approach them. On success, you will approach the animal in hunting range.
* **Kill.** Use your Stealth to approach and an attack roll (usually ranged) to kill the animal. On success, you take down the animal and your hunt is successful.

Anyone can attempt to hunt, however if the DC to locate, track or approach the animal is 17 or higher should only be possible to do by those proficient in the appropriate skill or weapon used to kill the animal. 

### Locating Prey

Any number of creatures can work together to locate hunting opportunities. All creatures spend one hour scouting and each makes a Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Survival) check. Any creature that has applicable Lore such as Hunting, Geography or Beasts related to the region has advantage to its roll. 

The highest result among all checks is compared on the table below to locate one or several hunting opportunities nearby, depending on the season and the terrain. 

|Abundance|  1 |  2 |  3 |  4 |  5 |  6 |  7 |  8 |
|:--------|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| Summer | 12 | 13 | 14 | 16 | 18 | 20 | 25 | 30 |
| Spring/Fall  | 13 | 15 | 17 | 20 | 25 | 30 | – | – |
| Winter  | 15 | 18 | 21 | 25 | 30 | – | – | – |
| Glacier  | 18 | 23 | 30 | – | – | – | – | – |

For each hunting opportunity, the DM roll d20 secretly and determines the time needed to tracks and the outcome.

| d20 | You Find | Time Required
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| 01-02 | False tracks or encounter	| 1 hour
| 03 | Tiny Game	| 1 hour
| 04-05 | Tiny Stealthy Game | 1 hour
| 06-08 | Small Game	| 1 hour
| 09-11 | Small Stealthy Game	| 2 hour
| 09-13 | Medium Game	| 1 hour
| 14-15 | Medium Stealthy Game	| 2 hour
| 16-17 | Large Game	| 2 hour
| 18 | Large Stealthy Game	| 3 hour
| 19-20 | Huge Game	| 3 hour

\columnbreak

## Tracking Prey

Any number of creatures can track a hunting opportunity. If the Locate checks found more than one opportunity, players can spread into multiple hunting parties increasing their chance of success by the end of the hunt. 

During tracking, all members of a hunting party make multiple Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Survival or Perception) checks against the prey's Passive Stealth. If any member has Hunting or Scouting Lore, they get advantage to their check. If at least one member beats the Passive Stealth, the hnting party has a success.

If the animal has a Stealthy behavior, double its proficiency modifier to its Passive Stealth if it is proficient, or add its proficiency bonus to Passive Stealth if it isn't. Creatures native to the terrain that have natural camouflage have their Passive Stealth increased by 5. Some terrains are difficult to track through and have a Minimum value which is used instead of Passive Stealth for the check, in cases where the animal's Passive Stealth will be lower. 

Depending on the terrain and weather conditions, the hunting party must succeed at a number of tracking rounds scoring a success following the tracks before they accumulate two failures where not even one member of the hunting party can beat the Passive Stealth of the creature. 

<div class="smalltab">

| Terrain Difficulty                                 | Successes | Minimum 
|:------------------------------------------------------|:--:|:--:|

|Mountain, high|4|17
|...after snowfall|+1|+2
|..after blizzard|+2|+5

</div>

<div style='margin-top:-6px'></div>

### Kill Prey

Once you have your quarry spotted, it is time to land the killing blow or attemp to wound the animal and capture it. Usually, all it takes is one well-aimed ranged attack roll against the Kill DC based on the animal size to land the killing blow. If you have Hunting Lore, you can double your proficiency with the attack roll. If the animal is Stealthy, you have disadvantage to that attack. You may attempt to attack a creature in a nonlethal way meant to weaken or slow it, so it can be captured. If you choose to do so, your attack roll must be against the Capture DC rather than the Kill DC.

You can attempt one or two consecutive Dexterity (Stealth) checks against the creature's Passive Perception. If the creature has advantage to Perception checks, it's Passive Perception is icreased by 3. If you succeed once, you ignore the disadvantage imposed by the creature's Stealthy behavior. If the creature is not Stealthy, you gain advantage to your ranged attack to Kill or Capture it.

\pagebreakNum

If you decide to attempt another Dexterity (Stealth) check and you also succeed, you gain advantage to a ranged attack roll, or you can attempt a melee attack roll or a grapple check, such as to mount it. If any of the Stealth checks fail, the animal detects your presence and may choose to escape.

If you fail your Stealth check by 5 or more, the creature is bold enough to attempt to attack or trample you, dealing damage listed in the table below. If the creature is also a monstrous creature, the creature may initiate combat rather than escape. 

| Size| 	Kill DC| 	Capture DC| 	Damage
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|Tiny	|DC 12	|DC 15	|—
|Small	|DC 14	|DC 17	|—
|Medium	|DC 16	|DC 19	|2d4
|Large	|DC 18	|DC 21	|2d8
|Huge	|DC 20	|DC 23	|3d12

### Harvesting and Preparing

After killing an animal, its meat, hide and exotic organs may be harvested. Separate supplements will be used by the DM to decide what can be harvested from the carcass. If a check is required, Beasts Lore or Medicine and Surgery Craft give advantage to the roll.

Before your meat can be eaten or sold it must be properly prepared. You need two lbs of meat in order to prepare a ration. When harvesting an animal, refer to the following list to determine how much meat is obtainable and long it will take to properly prepare it. You can prepare multiple rations during this time.

Raw meat that is not cooked within 24 hours begins to spoil. In cold weather the period to spoil is increased to 48 hours, and in extreme cold weather it is 72 hours. 

\columnbreak

|      Size   |      Lbs of Meat | Time Required |
|:--|:------:|:--------:|

>##### Starvation
>
>A creature can survive a number of days without food equal to 3 + Constitution (minimum of 4) modifier without ill effects other than the discomfort starvation. During this period of growing hunger, you no longer can recover exhaustion during short rests, and long rests recover only half your maximum hit points instead of all your hit points. 
>
> Once the period of hunger expires, you start to starve. You gain the first level of exhaustion if you don't have it and you can no longer remove that first level. At the start of a long rest, make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. Each additional day you continue without food, increase the DC by 2. If you succeed, you make another tortuous day without food. If you fail, your long rest recovers no hit points or hit dice, and the highest attribute score between your Strength and Constitution scores by 1d4. If either your Strength score or Constitution score becomes 0, you die of starvation.
>
>Attributes scores lost via starvation recover slowly. For each day of full recovery and access to enough food and water, you attempt a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you can increase either your Strength or Constitution score by 1d4, up to its original value before the effects of starvation.

## Tactical Gambits

The tactical gambit rules presented here are opt-in mechanical layer on top of normal 5e combat rules that allow players and foes to attempt heroic maneuvers typically depicted in fiction. 

The design prerogative of these options is to not change the balance of the game; and they are not meant to replace or invalidate any core rules like fighting styles, feats, existing combat actions, or classes like the battle master and their maneuvers.

Semantically a gambit is *when someone sacrifices a resource or an opportunity in order to achieve a potential upper hand in a conflict*. The gambits presented here allow a player to trade advantage or to take disadvantage on their attack roll for potential tactical benefits. This means that gambit benefits are curbed by the choice of taking a gamble. Thus both a player that actively embraces gambits, and a player that prefers to play it safe will be roughly equal in combat.

### Using Tactical Gambits
Once per turn, when you do not already have disadvantage on an attack, you can choose to perform a gambit while performing an attack by taking disadvantage to the attack. If you had advantage on the attack the gambit counters your advantage and you roll normally.

On a successful hit, in addition to the normal damage of your attack you can apply the benefits of the gambit you chose.

Additionally, as an optional rule, you may trade extra damage dice on a successful critical hit to use a gambit, however you must decide to do so before you roll any damage dice.

<!--

---
**Aimed shot.** *Range attacks only.* You take the time to aim extra carefully before shooting. You can ignore up to three-quarters cover on the attack. However because of your focus you cannot take attacks of opportunity until the start of your next turn. 
-->

---
**Arm Injury.** On a successful hit you slightly injure the target's arm, or an equivalent appendage. The target has disadvantage on the next weapon attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.

---
**Bash Shield.** *Melee attacks only.* On a successful hit you push aside the target's shield. The target cannot benefit from the protection of their shield until the start of its next turn.

---
**Careful Attack.** You attack very carefully. The next attack against you has disadvantage until the start of your next turn.

---
**Dig the wound.** If the target is already missing any of its hit points before your attack, you can aim for a weak point in it's defenses, roll a d6 and add it to the damage.

---
**Disorient.** On a successful hit you disorient the target, and it moves 5 feet in a random direction if it can move and its speed is at least 5 feet. Roll a d4 for the direction: 1, north; 2, south; 3, east; or 4, west. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks, and if the direction rolled is blocked, the target doesn't move.

---
**Distract.** The next attack roll against the target by an attacker other than you has advantage if the attack is made before the start of the target's next turn.

---
**Flat of the Blade.** *Melee attacks only.* You adjust your combat style to change the damage type of your weapon. You can choose to change the damage of your attack to bludgeoning, piercing or slashing.

---
**Hamstring** On a successful hit the target begins limping. It must spend an additional foot for every foot it moves until the end of its next turn. 

---
**Head hit, or Gut punch.** On a successful hit the target can't take reactions until the start of its next turn.

---
**Reckless Lunge.** You increase the reach of your attack by 5 feet for the attack.

---
**Mock, or Trick** *Requires Charisma 13 or higher.* On a successful hit, the target has disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes against you, as well as any Wisdom checks it performs before the end of its next turn.

---
**Pin Down.** After a successful hit against the target you can use a bonus action to pin the target to the ground, a wall, or another large object. A pinned creature is considered grappled by the object it is pinned to until it uses an action, or bonus action to free it's self, or the end of its next turn when it automatically breaks free.

---
**Pot shots.** *Range attacks only.* You aim carelessly for easy shots on nearby targets. After your attack you can use your bonus action to perform a second attack on a separate target, this second attack also suffers disadvantage. Both attacks must be performed on targets within 10-feet of you.

---
**Push.** *Melee attacks only.* On a successful hit you can push a target, that is of your size or smaller, 5-feet back while pursuing the target 5-feet. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks, and if the direction is blocked, you and the target don't move.

---
**Pull, or Lure.** *Melee attacks only.* On a successful hit you can move 5-feet away from the target and pull the same target, if it is of your size or smaller, 5-feet towards you. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks, and if the direction is blocked, you and the target don't move.

---
**Ricochet.** *Range attacks only.* You aim for a ricochet hit in an attempt to catch the target off guard. When performing a ricochet, you need line of sight to a surface or object that has line of sight to the target. When you perform a ricochet attack you ignore half cover and any shield bonus to AC the target might have.

---
**Tricky Pass.** *Melee attacks only.* When performing an attack of opportunity against a moving target you can perform a pass. On a successful hit you force the target to spend it's movement to move 5-feet in any direction of your choice. This forced movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.

---
**Unbalance.** After a successful hit against the target loses their balance. The target has disadvantage on checks, and saves to avoid being moved or forced prone until the start of it's next turn.
