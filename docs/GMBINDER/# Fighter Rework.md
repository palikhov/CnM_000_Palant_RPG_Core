### Fighting Style
You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose a fighting style from the list of optional features. You can't take the same Fighting Style option more than once, even if you get to choose again.

- **Archery:** You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.
- **Defense:** While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.
- **Dueling:** When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand or two hands and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon. 
- **Protection:** You can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on an attack roll that would hit an allied creature within 5ft of you being targeted by a creature you can see. If the attack hits anyways, you reduce the damage of the attack by an amount equal to your proficiency bonus + your shield AC bonus.
- **Two-Weapon Fighting:** When you engage in two-weapon fighting you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.

### Second Wind
You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

### Action Surge
Starting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action on top of your regular action.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Starting at 17th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on the same turn.

### Combat Superiority
As a 2nd level fighter you learn maneuvers that can be used in combat to control the tides of battle.

Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver’s effects, calculated as: 
___
**Maneuver save DC** = 8 + proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)
___
**Superiority Dice.** You have three superiority dice which are d6's. You expend and roll your superiority die when you use a Maneuver. You gain one more die each time you reach an archetype level in this class at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th levels respectively. When you take a short or long rest you regain your expended Dice. 

Starting at 11th level, when you roll initiative and have no superiority dice remaining, you regain one die.

### Fighter Maneuvers
You learn two maneuvers of your choice, which are listed in the Fighter Maneuver list. The full list of maneuvers is detailed at the end of the fighter section.

Your Class allow you some maneuvers, and your Martial Archetype will let you choose from an expanded list of maneuvers when you learn a maneuver, which are listed in the Archetype Maneuver list. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per turn. 

You learn one additional maneuver of your choice at 3rd level, and two additional maneuvers of your choice at 6th, 11th and 14th level. You can replace one maneuver you know for a different one each time you gain new maneuvers or level up. 

### Martial Archetype
At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate in your combat styles and techniques. The archetype you choose grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 6th, 8th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1, or you can take a Feat from the Feat List. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. 

The number of attacks increases to three when you reach 11th level in this class and to four when you reach 20th level in this class.

### Improved Fighting Style
At 9th level you more finely hone your combat prowess, gaining the following benefit in addition to the base bonus granted by your Fighting Style. If you know more than one Fighting Style, choose only one to improve.  

- **Archery:** You gain a +2 bonus to your damage rolls with ranged weapons. 
- **Defense:** You can use your reaction to impose Disadvantage on a weapon attack that would hit you. 
- **Dueling:** Your damage bonus increases to +3. 
- **Protection:** Your protection lasts until the start of your turn or you successfully block an attack. 
- **Two-Weapon Fighting:** You can still grapple when you engage in two-weapon fighting. 

### Indomitable
Also, starting at 9th level, your hardiness and resolve can overcome even the most impossible odds. Each time you make a Saving Throw you can roll a 1d4 and add it to the result. This increases to 1d6 starting at 13th level and 1d8 starting at 17th level.
