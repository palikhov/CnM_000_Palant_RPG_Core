Slightly modified archetype due to using some of its features in Ranger Re-Revised.
- **Revised Beastmaster** [here](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-L7a05G1cEt_d0c3Jskn "Beastmaster Revised")

### Favored Enemy
Beginning at 1st level, you have significant experience studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain type of enemy.

Choose a type of favored enemy: aberrations, beasts, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead. Alternatively, you can select two races of humanoid (such as gnolls and orcs) as favored enemies. You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your favored enemies, as well as advantage on Intelligence checks to recall information about them.

When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice that is spoken by your favored enemies, if they speak one at all, in which case you learn a language of choice. 

You learn more favored enemies, as well as more effective ways to fight them, as you gain higher  levels in this class. 

### Natural Explorer
Starting at 1st level you gain the following benefits:
- You ignore difficult terrain.
- On your first turn in combat, you have Advantage against creatures that have not yet acted.

In addition, you are skilled at navigating the wilderness. You gain the following benefits when traveling for an hour or more:

- Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.
- If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.
- While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.

### Fighting Style
At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options: Archery, Defense, Dueling, or Two-Weapon Fighting. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

#### Archery
You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.

#### Defense
While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

#### Dueling
When you are wielding a single melee weapon you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon. 

#### Two-Weapon Fighting
When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can make the extra attack as part of the attack action instead of as a bonus action. 

\columnbreak 

### Ranger's Wit
At 2nd level as a Ranger your mastery of movement lets you tap into a well of energy to confuse and confound your foes, which you execute through your Gambits. 

Some of your Gambits force your target to make a saving throw to resist the effect, calculated as:
___
**Gambit save DC** = 8 + proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)
___
**Wit.** You have a pool of Wit equal to half your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1) + half your ranger level, which you use to fuel your Gambits. You regain all expended Wit when you finish a long rest.

When you reach 11th level in this class your Wit improves to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1) + half your Ranger level.

### Gambits
You learn 2 Gambits of choice from the Ranger Gambit list. The full list is detailed at the end of the ranger section.

You learn an additional Gambit of choice at 3rd, 7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th level in this class. Each time you gain a new ranger level you can replace one Gambit you know with a different one. You can only use one Gambit per turn, unless otherwise specified.

### Spellcasting
By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the ranger spell list.

### Spell Slots
The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell animal friendship and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast animal friendship using either slot.
    
### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

When you gain a level in this class you can replace a spell you know for another valid spell from the Ranger spell list.

### Spellcasting Ability
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature.

Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

### Primeval Awareness
Beginning at 3rd level, your mastery of ranger lore allows you to establish a powerful link to beasts and to the land around you.

You have an innate ability to communicate with beasts, and by succeeding on an Animal Handling check, they recognize you as a kindred spirit. Through sounds and gestures, you can communicate simple ideas to a beast as an action, and can read its basic mood and intent. You learn its emotional state, its short-term needs (such as food or safety), and actions you can take (if any) to persuade it to not attack.

Additionally, you can attune your senses to determine if any of your favored enemies lurk nearby. By expending a Ranger Spell Slot and spending 1 uninterrupted minute in concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell), you can sense whether any of your favored enemies are present within 1 mile of you. You can sense their general number and direction. 

If there are multiple groups of your favored enemies within range, you learn this information for each group.

\columnbreak

### Ranger Archetype
At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate from the list of available archetypes. Your choice grants features at 3rd level, and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1, or you can take a Feat from the Feat List. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Natural Explorer Improvement
Starting at 6th level you gain the following benefits:
- You have advantage on initiative rolls.
- Difficult	terrain	doesn’t slow your group’s travel.
- Your group can’t become lost except by magical means.
- When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would.

### Favored Enemy Improvement
At 6th level, you choose one additional favored enemy, as well as an associated language. You gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls made against your favored enemies.  

### Fleet of Foot
Beginning at 8th level, you can use the Dash action as a bonus action on your turn.

### Steel Will 
Beginning at 9th level you gain Wisdom as a Saving Throw. If you already have Wisdom as a Saving Throw you can choose Intelligence or Charisma instead. 

### Hide in Plain Sight
Starting at 10th level, you can remain perfectly still for long periods of time to set up ambushes.

When you start your turn Hidden, you can opt to not move on that turn. If you avoid moving, creatures that attempt to detect you take a -10 penalty to their Wisdom (Perception) checks until the start of your next turn. You lose this benefit if you move or fall prone if you were not prone already, either voluntarily or because of some external effect. You are still automatically detected if any effect or action causes you to no longer be hidden.

If you are still hidden on your next turn, you can continue to remain motionless and gain this benefit until you are detected.

If you attack and hit a creature while you are hidden in this way, you can roll one additional weapon damage die, or two if the creature is a favored enemy. 

\pagebreakNum

### Evasion
Beginning at 13th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or a lightning bolt spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

### Vanish
Starting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can't be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you choose to leave a trail.

### Favored Enemy improvement
Also at 14th level, you choose one additional favored enemy, as well as an associated language. Your bonus damage against favored enemies increases to +4. 

### Favored Enemy Improvement
Starting at 17th level, you have advantage on saving throws against the spells and abilities used by your favored enemies.

### Feral Senses
At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can't see. When you attack a creature you can't see, your inability to see it doesn't impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it. You are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn't hidden from you and you aren't blinded or deafened.

### Foe Slayer
At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies. At the start of your turn you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack rolls or the damage rolls of your weapon attacks until the start of your next turn. When fighting a favored enemy, you add your Wisdom modifier to both rolls you make. 

Your beast companions gain half the effect rounded down.

## Ranger Gambits

- **Aid.** When a friendly creature within 5ft of you is hit with a weapon attack, you can expend 1 Wit and use your reaction to swap places with the allied creature. The original attack roll now targets you, dealing half damage if it hits. 
- **Escape.** When you are hit by a weapon attack you can expend 1 Wit and use your reaction to force that creature to make a Wisdom saving throw, with advantage if the attack was a critical hit. On a failed save the attack misses and you can move up to half your speed away from that creature without provoking an attack of opportunity. 
- **Fancy Footwork.** When you are targeted by a melee weapon attack by a creature within 5ft of you, you can expend 1 Wit and force the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save you swap positions with the creature and the attack has disadvantage; you do not provoke attacks of opportunity from this movement but the hostile creature does. 
- **Harry.** You can expend 1 Wit to target a hostile creature within 5ft of you and force it to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save that creature provokes an attack of opportunity if it attempts to take the Disengage, Dash, or Dodge actions until the start of your next turn. On a hit the creature wastes its turn. 
- **Pin.** When you hit a creature that is size Large or smaller with a weapon attack you can expend 1 Wit to pin it to the ground, halving its speed until the start of your next turn or the creature uses its action to become free. You cannot Pin creatures that are flying, are formless, or ethereal. 
- **Pocket Sand.** You can take the attack action and expend 1 Wit to force a target creature within 5ft of you to make a Constitution saving throw, on a failed save you blind it until the start of your next turn. If you have the extra attack feature, this attack replaces one of them. 
- **Sweeping Retaliation.** When a creature within 5ft of you misses you with a weapon attack you can use your reaction and force it to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save you knock the creature prone. 
- **Something Else.**
