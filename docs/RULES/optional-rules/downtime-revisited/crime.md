# Crime





Sometimes it pays to be bad. This activity gives a character the chance to make some extra cash, at the risk of arrest.Resources. 

A character must spend one week and at least 25 gp gathering information on potential targets before committing the intended crime.Resolution. 

The character must make a series of checks, with the DC for all the checks chosen by the character according to the amount of profit sought from the crime.

The chosen DC can be 10, 15, 20, or 25. Successful completion of the crime yields a number of gold pieces, as shown on the Loot Value table.

To attempt a crime, the character makes three checks: Dexterity \(Stealth\), Dexterity using thieves' tools, and the player's choice of Intelligence \(Investigation\), Wisdom \(Perception\), or Charisma \(Deception\).

If none of the checks are successful, the character is caught and jailed. The character must pay a fine equal to the profit the crime would have earned and must spend one week in jail for each 25 gp of the fine.

If only one check is successful, the heist fails but the character escapes.

If two checks are successful, the heist is a partial success, netting the character half the payout.

If all three checks are successful, the character earns the full value of the loot.

| Loot Value |  |
| :--- | :--- |
| DC | Value |
| 10 | 50 gp, robbery of a struggling merchant |
| 15 | 100 gp, robbery of a prosperous merchant |
| 20 | 200 gp, robbery of a noble |
| 25 | 1,000 gp, robbery of one of the richest figures in town |

Complications. 

A life of crime is filled with complications. Roll on the Crime Complications table \(or create a complication of your own\) if the character succeeds on only one check. If the character's rival is involved in crime or law enforcement, a complication ensues if the character succeeds on only two checks.
