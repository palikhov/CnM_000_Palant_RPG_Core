# Training





Given enough free time and the services of an instructor, a character can learn a language or pick up proficiency with a tool.Resources. 

Receiving training in a language or tool typically takes at least ten workweeks, but this time is reduced by a number of workweeks equal to the character's Intelligence modifier \(an Intelligence penalty doesn't increase the time needed\). Training costs 25 gp per workweek.Complications. 

Complications that arise while training typically involve the teacher. Every ten workweeks spent in training brings a 10 percent chance of a complication, examples of which are on the Training Complications table.
