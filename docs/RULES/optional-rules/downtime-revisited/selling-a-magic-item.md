# Selling a Magic Item





Selling a magic item is by no means an easy task. Con artists and thieves are always looking out for an easy score, and there's no guarantee that a character will receive a good offer even if a legitimate buyer is found.Resources. 

A character can find a buyer for one magic item by spending one workweek and 25 gp, which is used to spread word of the desired sale. A character must pick one item at a time to sell.Resolution. 

A character who wants to sell an item must make a Charisma \(Persuasion\) check to determine what kind of offer comes in. The character can always opt not to sell, instead forfeiting the workweek of effort and trying again later. Use the Magic Item Base Prices and Magic Item Offer tables to determine the sale price.

| Magic Item Base Prices |  |
| :--- | :--- |
| Rarity | Base Price\* |
| Common | 100 gp |
| Uncommon | 400 gp |
| Rare | 4,000 gp |
| Very rare | 40,000 gp |
| Legendary | 200,000 gp |
| \*Halved for a consumable item like a potion or scroll |  |

| Magic Item Offer |  |
| :--- | :--- |
| Check Total | Offer |
| 1—10 | 50% of base price |
| 11—20 | 100% of base price |
| 21+ | 150% of base price |

Complications. 

The main risk in selling a magic item lies in attracting thieves and anyone else who wants the item but doesn't want to pay for it. Other folk might try to undermine a deal in order to bolster their own business or seek to discredit the character as a legitimate seller. Every workweek spent trying to sell an item brings a 10 percent chance of a complication, examples of which are on the Magic Item Sale Complications table.
