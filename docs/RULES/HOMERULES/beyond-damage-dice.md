Politics in the Mharoti Empire are a battlefield, ™ and not all wars there are won with words.

Though this knife originated in the Dragon Empire, it is now wielded by assassins and cutthroat politicians throughout Midgard and the Southlands. Other than the two properties described below, the only difference between a standard dagger and a scorpion stiletto is price. The stiletto is a specialized assassination tool, so no one can just walk into a shop and buy one.

Any maneuver that can be used with a dagger can also be used with a scorpion stiletto.
