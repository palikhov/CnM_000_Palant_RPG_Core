Gauntlet

Spiked chain

Spiked shield

Hooked Shortspear martial melee weapon that deals 1d4 piercing damage, weighs 2 pounds, and has the light weapon property (see chapter 5, "Equipment," of the Player's Handbook). It doesn't possess the thrown or versatile weapon properties of a normal spear. On a hit with this weapon, the wielder can forgo dealing damage and attempt to trip the target, in which case the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or fall prone. The DC is 8 + the wielder's Strength modifier + the wielder's proficiency bonus.

Light Repeating Crossbow 1d8, piercing, 40/160 light repeating crossbow fitted with a cartridge that can hold up to six crossbow bolts. This weapon is similar to a light crossbow except that it has half the range (40/160 feet) and doesn't have the loading property. It automatically reloads after firing until it runs out of ammunition. Reloading the cartridge takes an action.
