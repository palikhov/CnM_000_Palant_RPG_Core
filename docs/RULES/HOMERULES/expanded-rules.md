# BATTLE FORMATIONS

Battle formations are specific combat maneuvers and positioning which grants some benefits or hindraces on the battlefield. From the simple circle formation to the complex testudo, all of them require coordination and some training to be performed. Every formation requires an Intelligence check to be performed, assigned by the DM, that can be done by the commanding officer or by the lowest intelligence member if the group is improvised. A failed check wastes the action and movement of the entire group. A long standing military unit has advantage to the formation, and a newly formed one or one composed by chaotic-aligned creatures has disadvantage to the roll. New Skill: Military training. A character with this skill can apply its proficiency bonus to Intelligence checks made to direct or teach a formation, train people in basic units, recall lore about fortifications, strategy and battle tactics or about ranks and offices in an army. This skill can be learned by Fighters, Paladins and Bards, or people with the Soldier, Noble or Knight backgrounds.

## Arrow Volley 

Difficulty: Easy

If at least ten archers are in the same line, they can release a high, arcing volley of arrows as an action. Rather than aiming at a specific target, they concentrate their arrows in an area, striking anything here. The creatures under an arrow volley must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity Save or being struck by 1d6 arrows which deal their normal damage without Dexterity modifiers. A testudo formation or a high shield wall protect as normal. Because they fire in a high arc, they can ignore any form of horizontal cover, such as horizontal shield walls or trenches. 

## Cavalry Charge 

Difficulty: Average 
Cavalry charges are shock tactics. A cavalry charge starts with a dash from the horses with a polearm such as a lance automatically wins initiative, and makes an attack when enters in its weapon’s reach. If it hits, the weapons doubles the damage dice \(EG: a lance in a cavalry charge deals 2d12+str. modifier piercing damage\) and the target must succeed on a Strength Saving Throw or being knocked prone and trampled by the mount. If more than half the cavalry units succeed on trampling their targets, it is considered a successful charge, and the enemy formations are broken. The targets must succeed a DC 15 to 20 \(if the cavalry is at about the same number of the defenders) Wisdom saving throw or being Frightened and flee of the battlefield.

The cavalry charge needs relatively flat, featureless terrain and cannot be performed on a difficult terrain, such as going up a hill or a forested plain. Also, infantry units can prepare for a cavalry charge if they have reach weapons and a disciplined formation such as a phalanx. If the phalanx readies an action to engage, they act first and the charging cavalry takes double damage and must succeed a Strength saving throw or being dismounted and knocked prone. 

## Cavalry Dash

Difficulty: Average A cavalry dash can be done only by trained horsemen and mounts. A cavalry dash has the same effects as any dash action, and doubles the movement of the mount. Any action with an area of effect (such as an arrow volley or  fireball) requires an Intelligence check with a DC of 8 + 1 for every 10 feet covered dashed or fail. This way, a warhorse cavalry moving 120 feet has a DC of 20. Also, even when the check is successful, the cavalry gains Advantage in dexterity saving throws. 

## Circle/Square Formation

Difficulty: Easy Creatures on a circle formation move at half speed but cannot be flanked. It is one of the easiest defensive formations. Line Difficulty-Very Easy The line is the base formation. Creatures in a line don’t hinder each other’s attacks and can focus fire and prepare to receive a charge. The main advantage of the line is its difficulty to be flanked, the protection of the rear ranks and the possibility to focus fire effectively. A line can move at their standard movement, Parthian Circle Difficulty: Average A Parthian Circle is a fast archer’s cavalry formation. The cavalry can use a reaction to move up to their horses’ speed when an enemy tries to approach to melee range or use a spell. Also, enemy projectiles have disadvantage to reach the formation. 

## Phalanx

Difficulty: Hard

As an action, a phalanx formation crams several creatures in a tight polearm formation at the cost of speed and attack capability. A phalanx reduces the movement speed by half, but allows cramming twice as much fighters in the same space. The phalanx must attack with polearms or spears, or do it at disadvantage. Any creature attacking frontally a phalanx does it at disadvantage, and automatically provokes opportunity attacks from anyone on reach if it doesn’t take the Disengage action. A phalanx can be combined with a shield wall or testudo for maximum defensive effectivity. 

## Shield Wall

Difficulty: Easy Anyone on the front rank of a shield wall has all the benefits of half cover; anyone in the second rank has three-quarters cover, and anyone beyond that has total cover. This formation reduces the speed of the creatures forming it in 10 feet, and attacks from weapons without a long shaft \(like spears or battleaxes\) are made at disadvantage. If the creatures pass the Saving Throw, they receive no damage from effects that require a Dexterity saving throw. Use: This is an effective formation to minimize the effects of area of effect spells, such as fireballs, as the first ranks may fall, but the second and third don’t. 

## Skirmish Formation 

Difficulty: Easy 

If the soldiers in a formation are concerned about large area effects, they sometimes advance at their speed every round and then ready an action to disperse if they hear the warning. When a formation disperses, the soldiers as a reaction can move up to their speed away from the center of the formation, and everyone else moves to a space not adjacent to any other soldier. This dispersal can help to reduce the casualties from a catapult or ballistae projectile or a powerful area of effect spell, such as a fireball. Even if they are in the center of the effect, the creatures have advantage in Dexterity saving throws as they are prepared to receive the spell, as if they had taken the Dodge action, although none of the other benefits applies. The main disadvantage of this practice is that tight groups of soldiers, such as a line formation, have advantage against the dispersed formation. Creatures in a very close formation, such as a phalanx, have disadvantage in the formation check. 

## Total Cover 

Difficulty:Average 
As an action, a group of creatures with shields spends all its movement and form an improved shield wall which grants total cover and advantage on Strength saves in one direction. A group in total cover cannot attack, automatically fails Dexterity saving throws and has disadvantage on Wisdom \(Perception\) checks that rely on sight. If the creatures already are in a shield wall formation, it only takes a reaction to form it. Use: The Total Cover is the poor man’s testudo formation, as it doesn’t need as much training to use. Creatures with proficiency on shields can use it at a command to protect themselves against projectiles. 

## Testudo 

Difficulty Very Difficult 

Trained creatures can spend an action to perform a testudo \(a bonus action if they are already in a phalanx or shield wall formation\). This formation consists on several creatures to form a close formation akin to the shield wall, but with a “roof” of shields too. Creatures under a testudo have total cover against any ranged attack or spell, and the same benefits of a shield wall against melee attacks or spells. Creatures inside a testudo halve their speed, and their attacks are made at disadvantage. Use: The testudo formation is the most effective defensive formation, but it has its weakness: it is very slow, and it is very easy to flank. Also, as the maneuver is highly coordinated, it is impossible to use it without proper training and coordination \(such as a soldier background, military training or the fighter class\): only professional soldiers such as hobgoblins can use it. Chaotic creatures are impossible to coordinate, and neutral creatures form a testudo in twice the normal time. Besides, creatures in a testudo formation have problems to attack enemy formations. Besides, a testudo can be easily broken by massive solid projectiles, such as a catapult’s fire, a ballista missile or a giant’s rock. Against such weapons, the soldiers forming the testudo automatically fail any dexterity saving throw. 

## Wedge

Difficulty: Average 

A wedge formation is used primarily for attack other formations. A wedge formation consists on a reinforced center to break the enemy lines and two “wings” to prevent being outflanked. The wedge has advantage against static or line formations on the first attack. Also, the units moving inside an enemy formation don’t provoke opportunity attacks from them. Use: This formation is usually used by heavy cavalry but also by heavy infantry to engage against enemy lines. Its main weakness is the dependence on the central column of attack. If the formation is pinned down, it can be broken easily and the enemy may flank it.

FORMATION   -   DC  -   TIME    -   EFFECT

Arrow Volley    -   10  -   Action  -   Area of effect 1d6 arrows’ damage. 

Cavalry Charge  -   15  -    Action  -   Wins initiative, weapons deal double damage; it frighten enemies if it breaks formations. Receives double damage by polearms.

Cavalry Dash  -   15  -   Action  -   AoE effects need a 8+1 per 10 feet covered DC skill check, and the cavalry has advantage in Dexterity checks

Circle  -   10  -   Action  -   Half movement, cannot be flanked Line 5 Movement Normal movement, difficult to flank, don’t hinder attacks.

Parthian Circle  -   15  -   Movement  -   Can dash as a reaction, attacks against it have disadvantage (light cavalry only).

Phalanx 20  -   Action  -   Half movement, provides opportunity attacks against anyone entering a rank’s reach, doubles the amount of units in the same space, doubles damage against charging creatures. 

Shield Wall  -   10  -   Bonus Action  -   Provides half cover in 1st rank, % in 2nd rank, total cover in 3rd; a successful dexterity save prevents all damage from that source \(soaked by the shield\).

Skirmish  -   10  -   Reaction  -   Can move as a reaction against an AoE.

Total Cover  -   15  -   Readied Ac. Movement becomes 0. Provides total cover in one direction.

Testudo  -   25  -   Action  -   Half movement, provides total cover, attacks are at disadvantage.

Wedge  -   15  -   Action  -   Breaks enemies’ formations, prevents opportunity attacks if breaks in.


# Literacy and languages

**Literacy:** Among the human populace literacy is not a given. In fact, for the majority of the populace “knowing your letters” is a rarity. It is not uncommon for someone to be able to speak many languages and simply be unable to read or write in any of them. As such literacy has become a soft social meter which displays either tutoring or noble blood.

There are four ways to gain literacy; race, background ,giving up a known language, or aquiring the linguist feat.

Both dwarves and elorii have strong traditions of education and gain literacy through their racial heritage. Some backgrounds grant literacy and if you choose a background which oes not grant literacy you may become literate by giving up one of your known languages.

# Modified Three Pillar

This version of three pillar experience rewards players for exploration and social interaction, while maintaining the traditional character advancement scale and allowing the GM to reward XP for encounters.

Instead of rewarding a fixed amount, for Exploration and Social Interaction players receive a percentage of the XP required for them to get from their current level to the next \(calculated from the base XP of their level to the next, not including XP they've earned in between.\)

They may receive a higher or lower percentage depending on the their tier of play compared to the magnitude of their accomplishment.   

## Gaining Levels

Players gain levels according to the normal PHB Character Advancement table.

## Role Play

This modified Three Pillar method also rewards players for inter-party role play. The difficulty of inter-party role play should remain fairly constant throughout all tiers of play, so unlike the other categories in this method it is not awarded based on tier. Instead, it is awarded for specific group activities.

When the party interacts in character during a session, each member gains 5%. If the interaction is only partially in character, they gain 2%. If they create a story-changing or divergent moment, they gain an extra 5%.

Here are some examples of these interactions \(obviously party interaction situations are not limited to these\):

* The party argues in character.
* The party comes to a decision in character.
* The party solves a mystery or puzzle in character.
* Some party members conspire to play a trick on another party member
* Some party members confront other party members about a problem or secret.
* The party convinces an NPC to give them information that the NPC previously did not want to give, a significantly lower price on an item, or another form of important help.
* More than half the party gains inspiration or role plays their traits, ideals, bonds, or flaws.
* The party agrees to take a quest from an NPC in need.  

## Social Encounters


# Combat

## Standard Combat

Standard Combat Encounter for XP is Deadly for max level of any of party members and it's give party 5% of XP for next level. If Encounter Difficulty was higher then Max Difficulty of next Tier (1-6), then party get another 5% .

Repeated Encounters can't give any XP if only they haven't Legendary Monster.

# Измененные правила верхового боя (боя верхом)

## Intelligent Creatures

Intelligent creatures are creatures that have a value of Intelligence of 6 or more. If such a creature is used as a mount, it acts independetly and can also attack as one of it's actions, as stated in the official rules. Intelligent creatures are independent creatures. Indeed there can be communication between the creature and it's master, however the creatures acts independently and thus have a turn of their own. This applies to also to riden mounts. These creatures are controlled by the DM.

NOTE: The only exception for this rule is the mount from the **Find Steed** spell. Due to the nature of the spell, that mount is controlled by the PC. Whether intelligent or not, each creature is still a beast at heart. It might disagree with the rider going in a certain direction such as jumping great heights. The DM might ask the PC to make a particular check whether to remain mounted or maybe the creature just runs off.

Intelligent creatures might challenge their master more then non-intelligent creatures, especially when the mount is being asked to do something that might hard for it, it considers dangerous or maybe something that it fears.

## Death of a Mount or Companion

Mounts roll for death saves. A dead mount can be resurrected if the requirements for a ressuraction spell are met. This applies also the companion creatures. Potions Potions and other consumables work as intended even on mounts. But so do the harmful effects of negative potions and poisons.

## Companion Needs

Just like a normal PC, mounts and pets have basic needs. They need: Food and Water to survive Rest after a long day To breathe Someone to take care of them Food and Water is either brought along before the adventure started or else it can be scavanged while in session. Most of the time it will be easy for the mount to be sustained while on an adventure, however some enviroments \(such as deserts or frozen landscapes\) will make it very hard and might possibly starve your mount. Normal exhaustion rules apply if a mount is not sustained.

Food and Water Needs

| Creature Size | Food per Day | Water per Day |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Tiny  |   1/4 pound |   1/4 gallon |
| Small  |  1 pound | 1 gallon |
|   Medium | 1 pound |  1 gallon |
| Large  | 4 pounds  |   4 gallons |
| Huge | 16 pounds  | 16 gallons  |
| Gargantuan  | 64 pounds |   64 gallons |

## Official Ruling from the D&D Player's Handbook 5e

```text
Resting after a long day is a big must if you want your mount to remain healthy. They will suffer normal exhaustion effects if they fail to rest or are being pushed over the limit. Breathing is a rather obvious need. Depending on the nature of the mount, different mounts can breathe in different enviroments and cannot in others. Sometime a PCs has to leave his mount behind if the mount cannot breathe in a certain enviroment he wants to explore. This takes us to the following need. Someone to take care of the mount is needed, especially if the mount is not Intelligent. As discussed before, most of the time the PC has to provide nurishment for his mount. If in danger, the PC needs to protect his mount. Most mounts cannot really fend of for themselves but are a very valuable asset when guided by someone. All of the above applies also for companion creatures. In town, adventurer owned mounts and beasts can be left at the stables were all their needs will be looked after. Stables are discussed in the next chapter.
```

## Riding a mount with no saddle

No saddle while mounting means that both the beast and the rider and uncomforable. The rider does not have anything that supports him on his mount. Any check done by the PC to remain mounted is done at a disadvantage. Any attack preformed by the PC will be at a disadvantage. While in combat, the rider has to perform a check to remain mounted if the mount moves and the rider does any other action other then try keep steady

## Combat Mechanics

In this section we are going to discuss the combat mechanics of a mounted PC and his mount.

### Mount Actions in Combat

A non-intelligent mount can take three different types of actions in combat, while an intelligent one can also take any other actions from its statblock.

#### Dash

A mount can take this action to move twice his normal movement speed.

#### Disengage

When disengaging a mount can move without triggering attacks of opportunity. \(Homebrew\) The rider will still provoke an attack of opportunity.\*

#### Dodge

The mount can take the dodge action as normal PC or NPCs can. However, only creatures attacking the mount itself will get disadvantage on attack rolls and only the mount will get advantage on Dexterity saving throws. The rider is not affected.

### Area of Effect on Mounted Creatures

When a mounted PC and his mount are inside the Area of Effect of a spell or effect, the rider can be affected too. If HALF the squares that make up the mount's token are inside the are of effect, and that effect affects in a 3D spectrum \(not only the ground\), then both rider and mount are effected.

### Ranged Attacks while Mounted

Riders doing ranged attacks while mounted will have disadvantage on the attack roll. This also applies to both ranged weapon attacks and ranged spell attacks.

### Animal Handling

Animal handling is a vital skill when it comes to mounts. A rider needs to be good with animals if it wants to ride one. If a character does not have proficiency in Animal Handling, all rolls related to keeping control of the mount and related will be at a flat DISADVANTAGE, no matter all the other roll modifiers. You still get the +/- modifier related to Animal Handling.

Note: A mount summoned by Find STEED does not require proficiency in animal handling since the nature of the spell.

### Keeping Control of the Mount

At the start of every turn, a mounted creature has to succeed a DC 10 Animal Handling check. This check is straight forward. If the character has proficiency in Animal Handling then he rolls with advantage. If the character does not have Animal Handling, he rolls with disadvantage. If he fails the Animal Handling check then he must succeed DC 10 Dexterity saving throw \(modifiers from saddle's apply\) otherwise he will be knocked prone 5ft away from the mount and take 1d6 bludgeoning damage. The mount will dash as far as possible away from it's rider. That will be the end of the rider's turn. If the rider succeeds the Dexterity saving throw, he will land on his feet 5ft next to the mount. He will still have his turn, but the mount will still be spooked off.

## Melee Reach

Mounted combat adds a 3 Dimenstional element to combat. Every creature has his own height. If you ride on top of a creature, you are standing on that creauture's back, hench elevated from the ground by that creature's height. Each mount has a height value stated in it's character sheet. That value is the distance the rider is standing above the ground when riding the said mount.

Mounted character melee weapon without "REACH" attribute:

Mount Size Cannot hit

Medium - None

Large - Tiny or smaller

Huge - Medium or smaller

Gargantum - Large or smaller

Mounted character melee weapon with "REACH" attribute:

Mount Size Cannot hit

Medium - None

Large - None

Huge - Medium or smaller

Gargantum - Large or smaller

**Note:** These melee range restrictions also apply when a creature of the stated size wants to attack the rider who is standing on a mount.

For example a medium or smaller sized creature, wielding a melee weapon without the 'Reach' attribute, cannot hit the rider of a Huge or bigger mount.

# Magical Items Tweaks and clarification

## Attuned and non-attuned properties

Aegis of the Crusader
Armor (breastplate), rare (requires attunement)
Description: This armor set consists of a stylized 
breastplate, greaves, vambraces and a crested helm.
History: Designed by the dwarven armorers of Solanos 
Mor that accompanied the first Crusade of Light, each suit 
of aegis is dedicated to a specific god from the Pantheon of 
Man. The chosen god’s iconography and selected passages 
from the Holy Canticle is emblazoned upon the breastplate 
of the aegis. Given the cost to construct these suits of 
armor, new ones are rarely commissioned from the dwarven 
smiths, though the Mother Church of Coryan has been 
known to do so when the occasion demanded.
Abilities/Effects: You may only become attuned to the 
aegis of the crusader if you worship the same deity to which 
the armor is dedicated. While wearing this armor, you gain 
a +1 bonus to AC, which increases to +2 if you are also 
capable of casting divine spells.
Divine Blessings: This magic armor has 3 charges. While 
wearing it, as an action you may expend 1 charge to cast 
the spell listed on the table below. Whenever this special 
ability of the aegis is activated, a brief momentary image of 
an angelic Valinor appears around the wearer. This armor 
regains 1 expended charge daily at dawn or 2 charges if the 
armor is directly exposed to the light of the rising sun.
Deity Spell
Althares see invisibility
Anshar misty step
Beltine prayer of healing
Cadic invisibility
Hurrian aid
Illiir bless
Larissa augury
Neroth lesser restoration
Nier false life (cast at 2nd level)
Saluwe pass without trace
Sarish protection from evil and good
Yarris water breathing

Armor of Illiir’s Light
Armor (medium), rare
Description: This enchanted suit of medium armor is 
crafted from the finest quality forged steel with small 
ornamental plates adorned with orbs of light with lines 
radiating to the edge like the rays of the sun.
History: Once scores of these armors were crafted and 
gifted to the worthiest holy champions of Illiir, but after 
the fall of the Imperium of Man, the skill to do so was lost. 
Now, other than those suits found in moldering crypts or 
pried from the clutches of creatures undeserving of such 
a gift, all others have been lost, awaiting discovery by the 
daring and pious.
Abilities/Effects: This set of medium armor grants you +1 
bonus to AC.
Illiir’s Light: As an 
action you may 
cause your 
armor to 
shine like the 
sun for 1 
minute. 
It issues 
forth 
bright 
light in a 15-
foot radius and 
dim light for an 
additional 15-feet 
beyond. The light 
from your armor 
penetrates 
any form of 
darkness. If 
the light 
shed by 
your 
armor 
overlaps 
an area of darkness 
caused by a spell of any level, 
that spell is dispelled. Once this effect is 
used it may not be activated again until the next dawn.

Battledress of the 
Mercenary Captain
Armor (heavy), rare
Description: This exceptionally crafted heavy armor is 
covered with black enamel and inlayed with precious 
metals.
History: This armor is highly sought after by military 
leaders across the Known Lands, where the battledress 
is designed in the style of the commander’s nation of 
allegiance: lorica squamata for the Coryani, Andrean plate 
for Milandisians, gothic plate for the Cancerese, and so on. 
Merchant princes who ply their trade across the continent 
are always interested on acquiring ancient versions of 
this armor as they fetch high prices from noble lords to 
mercenary captains alike.
Abilities/Effects: This set of armor grants you +1 bonus to 
AC. If you are wearing the version of the armor appropriate 
to your nation of allegiance or if you are proficient with all 
martial weapons, you also have advantage on all Charisma 
(Persuasion) checks made while in combat.
Brotherhood of the Scar 
Armor
Armor (leather), rare (requires attunement)
Description: This tight-fitting jerkin is made of 
tough, but pliable leather and dyed a dark color 
with engraved red accent decorations.
History: The people of Savona are 
usually stereotyped as hedonistic 
ne’er-do-wells, concerned with 
nothing more than enjoying 
life to its fullest. Though 
superficially true, they have a 
strong sense of honor where 
slights to their character, 
station or nobility must be 
given satisfaction. Due to 
this, a number of schools 
teach the art of dueling 
to supply the city with 
sufficient swordsmen for 
hire to bring satisfaction 
to the aggrieved.
The most infamous of 
these schools is the 
Brotherhood of the Scar, 
due to their practice of the sword 
master marking a graduating pupil 
with a cut across the cheek. Upon 
mastering the necessary skills, the 

student is given the leather jerkin, marking them as one of 
the deadliest swordsmen in the Known Lands.
Abilities/Effects: This armor grants a +1 bonus to your 
Armor Class. While wearing this armor, you can gain the 
benefits of the Fighting Styles Duelist and Two-Weapon 
Fighting at the same time
Campaign Armor
Armor (any medium), uncommon
Description: These fine suits of medium armor seem 
common at first glance but are fashioned from the highest 
quality leather, hides, or steel, and are carefully articulated, 
proportioned until finally, they are enchanted to allow for 
maximum comfort and range of motion.
History: Designed originally by the Tir Betoqi dwarves 
for use by their commanders while out on campaign, an 
enterprising merchant invested in commissioning a dozen 
and sold them to human military leaders and nobles. Once 
word spread about the miraculous set of armor, the dwarf 
was inundated with orders, making him very rich indeed.
Abilities/Effects: You may sleep in this armor for as many 
nights as your Constitution bonus without incurring any 
penalties. This armor may be donned in 5 rounds and 
removed in just 1.Corselet of the Duelist
Armor (studded leather), rare (requires attunement)
Description: This close-fitting doublet-styled jacket is 
reinforced with expertly arranged internal plates 
of hard leather, giving it superior protection 
while retaining remarkable flexibility.
History: Best suited to the nimble and 
flashy fighter, this armor is enhanced to 
aid balance and speed. It is believed that 
the first duelist jacket was fashioned for 
Mannulus val’Sheem, founder of the Red 
Sword Duelist School in Old Coryan. 
Detractors of the master swordsman 
point to the armor’s ability as the reason 
for his prowess, rather than Mannulus’ 
skill. This has led to many a bloody 
duel between the master duelist’s 
students and those of rival schools.
Abilities/Effects: While worn, this 
armor grants a +1 bonus to your 
AC. When a creature that you can 
see attacks you with a melee weapon, you can 
use your reaction to gain an additional +1 bonus 
to your AC.

Brotherho od of 
the Sc ar Armor

Cuirass of the Hussar
Armor (breast plate), rare
Description: This is an elaborately engraved cuirass of 
polished steel affixed on the back with two hook-rods 
fashioned to look like feathers that project as high as three 
feet above the shoulders.
History: With the skill to manufacture this armor lost to 
the ages, those pieces that do exist are family heirlooms, 
handed down through the generations. Those Milandisians 
possessing the cuirass are recruited into the cavalry, where 
their exceptional ability gives them an edge over raiding 
Yhing hir horsemen.
Abilities/Effects: While worn, this armor grants you a 
+1 bonus to your AC. This armor has 3 charges. When 
mounted, as a bonus action you may expend 1 charge to 
increase your mount’s walking speed by 20 feet or grant 
your mount the ability to jump 3 times its normal distance. 
This armor regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.
Garb of the Foresters 
of the Golden Boughs
Armor (studded leather), uncommon
Description: This armor is 
fashioned from hardened 
bone that reinforces a cured 
leather jerkin lined with furs. 
The exterior of the armor is 
typically covered by a woven 
‘tabard’ of grasses and tree 
foliage.
History: The foresters of the 
Golden Boughs of Saluwé, 
make use of these armors 
to remain concealed from 
the terrible creatures and 
dangers that lurk within 
the serene glades of the 
Golden Boughs. The use of 
this armor has led to the legend 
told by poachers and hunters that 
enter the sacred forest in search rare 
game, that it is defended by plant 
demons. As long as it keeps such 
hunters out of the area, the foresters 
are more than happy to perpetuate 
this myth.
Abilities/Effects: While this 
armor is worn in a forest it grants a +5 
bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) and Wisdom 
(Perception) checks.

Hide of the Beast
Armor (Hide), very rare (requires attunement)
Description: Crafted from the skin of a fierce predator, 
like a bear or wolf, this hide armor is fashioned to give the 
appearance of that creature.
History: Warriors of various barbaric tribes, such as the 
Yhing hir and Chauni, hunt a fearsome local predator and 
bring its carcass back to their shaman. Invoking the spirit 
of the predator and appeasing it through animal sacrifice, 
the shaman convinces it to merge again with the hide and 
granting the wearer its power.
Abilities/Effects: While worn, this armor grants a +1 
bonus to your Armor Class. If you possess the Rage ability, 
you have advantage on all Charisma (Intimidation) checks. 
In addition, you can Wild Shape as a druid, using your 
character level as your druid level. Once you use this ability, 
you cannot do so again until the next dawn.Horsehair Cuirass
Armor (breastplate), rare
Description: Armorers of the Yhing hir tribes create 
these exquisitely crafted fine suits of armor from 
the hides of buffalo, wildebeests and 
other thick-skinned dwellers of the 
Hinterlands. For chieftains, armor 
is crafted from the sacred hide of the 
Shovel Horned Rhinoceros.
History: Though feared and shunned 
by the Yhing hir, the mystic Ehtzara 
are sought out for their knowledge 
of how to forge a bond between a 
rider and their mount. When a 
rider is found worthy, usually due 
to acts of heroism rather than 
station, a cuirass is brought before 
an Ehtzara, along with a long 
braided cord made up of the 
rider’s hair and strands from the 
horse’s mane. The Ehtzara then calls 
upon the spirits to enchant the suit 
and creating a connection between 
the two.
Abilities/Effects: While worn, 
this armor grants you a +1 bonus to 
AC. Additionally, you may speak with 
your mount as if using the speak with 
animals spell.
Garb of the 
Foresters of the 
Golden Boughs

Ice Shard Armor
Armor (scale mail), rare (requires attunement)
Description: Brilliant blue ice shards, 
magically enchanted to remain 
frozen and for strength, form 
the body of this scale mail.
History: The method for 
crafting this enchanted 
suit of armor was first 
discovered by Ice Giants 
and subsequently taken when 
they were enslaved by Celestial 
Giants. Since Illiir’s Curse, the 
former Celestial Giants, now 
dwarves, have continued to forge this 
exotic armor for those of a smaller 
stature.
Abilities/Effects: This armor 
grants the wearer resistance to 
cold damage and advantage 
on all Constitution saving 
throws made due to being in 
a cold environment.
Khitani 
Rune Robe
Armor (Special), very rare 
(requires attunement by a spellcaster)
Description: This finely made robe is 
fashioned from painted paper, sewn to a layer of fine silks. 
Each paper strip is painted with arcane runes and sigils.
History: The Khitani portray themselves as a highly cultured 
people, preferring to use words rather than daggers in court. 
However, they are not blinded to the fact that assassinations 
are an expedient way of eliminating obstacles and so wear 
this “armor” while attending the various courts across the 
Khitani Empire or those across the Known Lands.
Abilities/Effects: While wearing this armor, you may 
expend a spell slot, directing its energy into the robe. You 
gain an Armor Class equal to 10 + the level of the spell slot 
expended + your Dexterity modifier. This effect lasts 24 
hours during which you may not expend any more spell 
slots in this way.
Marine’s Brigandine
Armor (leather), very rare
Description: This enchanted suit of leather armor is made 
of ironwood plates inserted into articulated overlapping 
strips of tanned and cured shark hide which are riffled in 
texture to suggest the play of wind on water.

History: Crafted by Milandisian armorers and blessed by 
the priests of Yarris, these rare brigandines are expensive 
to manufacture, but are invaluable to Milandir’s 
navy. With pirate infested waters to the north 
and the ever-present danger of the black ships 
of Ymandragore, as well as all sorts of 
dangerous sea creatures like the Devil 
Fish or the Lurkers Beneath, having a 
group of warriors able to battle on the 
ocean surface as if it were solid land is a 
tactical edge worth the expense.
Abilities/Effects: While wearing this armor, 
you gain a +1 bonus to AC. This armor has 3 
charges. While wearing this armor, you may expend 
1 charge to cast water walk . This armor regains 
1d3 expended charges at dawn. If you expend the 
armor’s last charge, roll a d20. On a roll of 1, the 
armor loses all magical properties until it is 
submerged in ocean water for an entire day, 
after which it regains 1 charge and all of its 
magical properties.
Minstrel’s Mail
Armor (chain shirt), uncommon
Description: Finely woven links of chain 
are sandwiched between layers of fine cloth 
forming an entertainer’s outfit.
History: Many believe that minstrels, bards and 
other entertainers lead a life of merriment and relative 
tranquility, but they fail to note that those following 
this profession travel long distances and across dangerous 
territory to acquire new stories, poems and songs. Bandits, 
marauders and criminals of all sorts may be found without 
warning upon the open road. This chain shirt is light 
enough to wear under traveling clothes, yet strong enough 
to turn a blade and save the wearer’s life.
Abilities/Effects: While wearing this armor, if you possess 
the Bardic Inspiration ability you gain an additional bardic 
inspirations die.
Roofwalker’s Hauberk
Armor (studded leather), rare
Description: This armor consists solely of a chest protector, 
held in place by four straps, and a set of arm guards.
History: Used by a notorious ring of thieves that plundered 
the great keeps of Milandir for over a decade, stealing a 
king’s ransom of jewels and coins, these suits were credited 
with their ability to scale the high defensive walls with ease. 
The thieves were eventually caught and found to be a group 
of misshapen gnomes. They were condemned to hang for 
their crimes, but the suits were “misplaced”, though rumors 

Ice Shard Armor


17

of them being used by different 
criminals have surfaced 
over the years.
Abilities/Effects: 
While worn, this 
armor grants you a 
+1 bonus to AC and 
you gain advantage 
on all Strength 
(Athletics) checks 
while climbing. The 
arm guards contain 
a number of small 
pockets that can 
be used to store 
specialist’s tools, 
small weapons and 
similar items. There 
are five pockets on 
each arm, and each 
pocket can hold 1 lb.

Scales of 
Yarris
Armor (Scale mail), 
uncommon 
(requires attunement)
Description: This exquisitely 
crafted enchanted suit of 
armor is made from the shells 
of the giant scallops harvested from the Gulf of Yarris.
History: Bestowed upon those who served valiantly in the 
service of the crown, the suit is a clear display of the favor 
of the Milandisian Kings. These suits are highly prized by 
those knights that serve as officers in the Royal Navy, as the 
bulky armor needed for fierce boarding actions is a death 
sentence to those tossed overboard.
Abilities/Effects: While wearing this armor you can 
breathe underwater and gain a swim speed of 30 feet. 
If you are using the variant rule: encumbrance, this 
armor’s weight does not count towards the weight you 
are carrying.
Shade Hunter
Armor (Splint), very rare (requires attunement)
Description: This is a dark-gray suit of splint mail 
decorated with images of skulls and spirits adorning its 
spiked surfaces.
History: Crafted by the skilled armorers of Enpebyn 
and enchanted by Beltinian priests, these rare suits of 
armor are given to champions sent to deal with dangerous 

undead. Even with the powers granted by the shade hunter 
suit, many fail, their broken bodies left to rot within the 
enchanted armor only to be discovered years later.
Abilities/Effects: When worn, this armor grants a +2 
bonus to AC as well as resistance to necrotic damage. As 
a bonus action, you may force all undead within 30 feet 
of you to make a DC 16 Charisma saving throw, suffering 
4d6 radiant damage on a failed save and half as much on 
a successful one. Once this ability is used, it may not be 
called upon again until the next dawn.
Tourney Armor
Armor (heavy), uncommon
Description: Upon first seeing this elaborately inlayed 
gold and steel armor, most think it is intended for parade. 
However, it is fully functional battle armor. Some suits of this 
armor are further embellished with either colored lacquers or 
precious stones, or both for particularly opulent suits.
History: These suits of armor originated in Milandir 
during an extended period of peace. Knights across the 
kingdom were 
encouraged 
to 
participate 
in jousts 
and other 
mock 
combat as 
a way of 
channeling 
the nobles’ 
aggressive 
tendencies. 
Since then, 
many of these 
suits of armor 
have been 
bartered or 
sold to settle 
family debts, 
usually incurred in 
the armor’s crafting.  
This has resulted in 
some of these suits 
being discovered 
in the strangest of 
places.

Ymandrake 
Spellweaver Armor
Armor (studded leather), very rare (requires attunement by an 
arcane spellcaster)
Description: Finely tooled and imbued with powerful 
enchantments, this otherwise plain looking studded leather 
armor is coveted by arcane casters across the Known Lands.
History: First seen worn by Ymandrake Harvesters, the 
armor was quickly duplicated by the sorcerers of the 
Sanctorum of the Arcane, for their own use.
Abilities/Effects: While worn, this armor grants a +1 
bonus to AC. Additionally, if you can cast spells you can 
cast cantrips as if you were 5 levels higher.rituals and techniques they can use to remove runes from an 
item, emptying a rune slot and preparing the item to receive 
another rune. Once an item’s rune slots are full, any attempt 
to inscribe another rune on the item without first clearing 
one of its slots will cause the item to tear itself apart.
Inscribing Runes
Inscribing a rune is time-consuming, expensive and 
dangerous. Such a task requires the specialized training 
and experience of a runesmith who spend decades learning 
and perfecting their craft. Due to the challenging nature 
of their studies, runesmiths often demand rare materials, 
help with a difficult task or promises of future favors, in 
addition to the materials costs of the rune. In order to 
inscribe a rune, a runesmith must be of an appropriate 
character level and spend an amount of money and time 
as indicated on the chart below. If you are inscribing a 
blessed rune, you must dedicate the rune to a deity that 
you worship.


# Magic items

Knowledge scrolls
Knowledge scrolls are commonly produced by spellcasters
to record what they have learned and teach the reader the
proper mental state, body position, hand motions, and any
material components necessary to cast a spell. To learn a
spell from a knowledge scroll, the spell must be of a level that
you have spell slots. The spell must also be one that could
normally be on your spell list. For example, you cannot
learn an arcane spell from the Elder Tradition if you are a
human cleric, nor can you learn a val’Borda secret spell if
you are a val’Inares.
After 1 hour spent studying the scroll, make an ability
check. The ability you use depends on the Arcanum of the
spell. If the spell is divine, you must make a Intelligence
(Religion) skill check; if it is an arcane spell you must make
an Intelligence (Arcana) skill check. In either case, the DC
is equal to 15 + the spell’s level.
If you succeed, the spell is added to your spell list. If you
prepare spells, you can now select the spell you learned as
one of your prepared spells. If you have a separate list of
spells known, you can choose one of the spells you know and
replace it with the spell you learned. You can also replace one
of the spells you know with the spell you just learned when
you gain a level in your spellcasting class, like normal.
If you fail, you do not learn the spell. Regardless of
whether the check succeeds or fails, the scroll is destroyed
in the process.
Spell Scrolls
Spell scrolls allows anyone, even someone without the ability
to wield the Arcanum, to cast the spell inscribed upon it
without providing any material components. Casting the
spell by reading the scroll requires the spell’s normal casting
time. Once the spell is cast, the scroll crumbles to dust. If
the casting is interrupted, the scroll is not lost.
If your proficiency bonus does not equal or exceed the
minimum proficiency bonus show in the Spell Scroll table,
you must succeed on an ability check to determine whether
you can successfully channel the magic of the scroll.
If the spell is divine, you must make an Intelligence
(Religion) ability check. If it is an arcane spell you must make
an Intelligence (Arcana) ability check. In either case, the DC is
equal to 10 + the spell’s level. If you succeed, you successfully
cast the spell. If you fail, you speak meaningless words of
power and nothing happens. Regardless of whether the check
succeeds or fails, the scroll is destroyed in the process.
The level of the spell on the scroll determines the spell’s
saving throw DC and attack bonus as well as the spell’s
rarity, as shown in the Spell Scroll table.

Fetishes
Whether called a talisman, charm or juju, fetishes act as
either wards against evil spirits and other supernatural
dangers, or to channel the power of benevolent spirits to
grant some effect. Trained sorcerers and priests scoff at such
items as foolish superstition or the work of charlatans, but
those that believe know better and pay trusted shamans,
witchdoctors and undir dacoi for these gifts.
For additional fetishes see Forged in Magic: Reforged.
Animal Fetishes
The most common fetish created by shamans across
Arcanis, animal fetishes are made by infusing the power of
primal animal spirits into an item. These fetishes must be
worn openly on your person, not concealed in a pouch or
pocket, in order to gain their benefits.
Boar Fetish
Wondrous item (fetish), common
Description: This fetish is made from a pair of boar tusks
held together by rawhide straps and decorated with fur
strands holding colored beads.
Abilities/Effects: Wearing this fetish grants you
advantage on death saving throws. If you ever roll a 1 on
a death saving throw, you can call on the power of this
fetish to succeed on that saving throw. The fetish then
crumbles into dust.
Dolphin Fetish
Wondrous item (fetish), uncommon
Description: This colorful bracelet consists of shells and
beads, tethered to a strap of rawhide stained with the dried
blood of a dolphin. Regardless of its age or conditions, the
bracelet always smells of brine.
Abilities/Effects: Wearing this fetish grants you a +2 bonus
on Strength (Athletics) checks to swim. You can call on the
power of this fetish to cast water breathing once, without
expending a spell slot or requiring components. The fetish
then crumbles into dust.
Serpent Fetish
Wondrous item (fetish), rare
Description: This fetish consists of thin strips of snake skin
wrapped around the crowns of snake fangs, binding them
to a strip of rawhide. It is commonly made in the form of a
bracelet, anklet, or necklace.
Abilities/Effects: Wearing this fetish grants you advantage
on all saves to resist the poisoned condition. When you take
poison damage or gain the poisoned condition you may,
as a reaction, call on the power of this fetish to end the
condition and gain resistance to poison damage for 1 hour.
The fetish then crumbles to dust.
Monster Fetishes
These fetishes are rarer than animal fetishes as the talisman
requires some portion of the creature to draws forth it’s
power. These fetishes must be worn openly on your person,
not concealed in a pouch or pocket, to gain their benefits.
You must wear a monster fetish for a full day before you
receive its benefit.
Ssanu Fetish
Wondrous item (fetish), very rare
Description: This headdress consists of the upper half of
an adult ssanu skull, bleached white and inscribed with
runes. Due to the components required, these fetishes are
incredibly rare.
Abilities/Effects: Wearing this fetish grants you the ability
to cast detect magic as a ritual. You can also cast arcane
sight* (DC 15) once, without expending a spell slot or
providing components. Once you do so, you cannot use the
fetish in this way until you complete a long rest.
Additionally, while wearing this fetish you can speak the
Ssethric and Ss’ressen languages as if you were a ssethric
creature.
Bloodbeak Hummingbird Fetish
Wondrous item (fetish), uncommon
Description: This fetish consists of several bloodbeak
hummingbird feathers set into a bone clasp. It is commonly
worn as a hair clasp.
Abilities/Effects: If you fall while wearing this fetish,
you may, as a reaction, call upon the power of this fetish
to slow your descent. Your rate of descent slows to 60
feet per round. When you land, you take no damage
from falling and you land on your feet. The fetish then
crumbles into dust.
> WHY RUNES?
> With so many magical items, why runes? Runes grant both players and game masters a way to customize items within a structured rules format. Beyond that, they help alleviate one of the oldest issues in most roleplaying games: discarding one magical item for a better one, regardless of the weapon's history or significance. When characters find "better” items, they are suddenly seeking a buyer for their less potent items
> By adding a rune to a non-magical suit of armor or weapon of personal or historical significance, a character can create a useful magical item without sacrificing a roleplaying hook. Picking up your father's blade to hunt down his assassins is more appealing, when the blade has a rune or two to make it a magical sword, rather than just a sharp hunk of metal.


 
No one is certain who developed the techniques for inscribing runes, but evidence shows that they were used by the Eladru cyclops as well as the ssethrics of Yahssremore. Scholars debate how humanity learned this craft. The dominant theory is that they were taught by the elorii before the Great Betrayal, or perhaps gifted humans learned to duplicate the power of eloran enchantments through sheer determination. Dwarven runesmiths all agree that their ancestors, the celestial giants, had mastered the craft, though there is no consensus as to when they appeared upon Arcanis. Runic magic is a complex merging of magical ritual and exacting craftsmanship in order to produce magical reservoirs that capture and direct energy into desired patterns. Few have the patience and devotion required to become a runesmith as mastering these techniques is a long, difficult, and sometimes deadly process.
Each rune is an individual work of art, a pattern carefully inscribed into an item and then imbued with magical energy. Runes are visually distinct by type and craftsman, and individual runesmiths can be easily identified by their designs.
Runes
GFFeCtS
& uses
Runes are inscribed on non-magical items to grant them magical properties. Each rune’s effect depends upon the type of item the rune is inscribed upon. A fire rune on a weapon allows you to envelop the weapon in flames, while that same rune placed upon on a suit of armor grants you a measure of protection against fire damage.
With few exceptions, runes may only be inscribed upon mundane items such as spellcasting foci, weapons, shields, or suits of armor. While there are other enchanted items which may take advantage of runes or have space for additional runes, these are exceedingly rare.
 
Rune Quality and Slots
Runes come in a variety of rarities, from uncommon all the way to legendary. Very rare and legendary runes require the wielder to be attuned to the item bearing the rune in order to gain their full potential. If the wielder is not attuned to the item, it is treated as having the effects of an uncommon rune of that type (if one exists).
Magic is the power of creation, and just as the strain of its use takes its toll upon a spellcaster, it also takes its toll upon the various inanimate materials it infuses. Since magical energy is not woven into the item during its creation but instead added later, inscribing a rune creates a great deal of tension within the item.
Any one mundane item has 3 rune slots, each of which can hold a single uncommon rune. Inscribing a rune onto an item fills one these slots. Runes at higher rarity take up more slots since they must have larger and more intricate patterns in order to hold more magical energy. Runesmiths have rituals and techniques they can use to remove runes from an item, emptying a rune slot and preparing the item to receive another rune. Once an item’s rune slots are full, any attempt to inscribe another rune on the item without first clearing one of its slots will cause the item to tear itself apart.

## Amalgamated Runes

As runes (attunement required)
Description: This technique allows the runesmith to create a specialized rune that allows the wielder access the powers of one of the two runes that make up an amalgamated rune, with but a moment’s concentration. The technique required to inscribe an amalgamated rune are known only by a select few, making the cost of such an inscription quite costly.
Abilities/Effects: An amalgamated rune entwines two runes into one, allowing you to switch to either rune’s properties as a bonus action. Thus, you may have an amalgamated fire/air rune and switch between one benefit or the other. The runes that form the amalgamated rune must be of the same quality and each may only be of uncommon or rare quality. An item may only hold one amalgamated rune. You must attune to an item bearing an amalgamated rune in order to use the rune’s properties.

## Blessed Runes
As runes (attunement required)
Description: These runes are frequently used by religious institutions for use by their priests and holy champions.Accessing the powers of a blessed runes is as much a test of faith as of skill and power.
Abilities/Effects: Blessed runes work in all ways like standard runes except that they are dedicated to a particular deity. Regardless of rarity, you must attune to an item bearing a blessed rune and in order to attune to the item you must worship the same deity the rune is dedicated to. If multiple blessed runes are inscribed on the same item, they must all be dedicated to the same deity.

## Entwined Runes
Description: Dariac, a young apprentice of Elebac of Solanos Mor, accidentally rediscovered the techniques required to access a rune’s full range of abilities.
Abilities/Effects: These specialized runes allow a wielder to access two of the rune’s effects, switching between them as a bonus action. For example, if you wield a sword with an entwined fire rune you are able to access both the rune’s weapon and spellcasting focus abilities, while that same rune upon armor also grants access to the rune’s weapon ability, allowing you to empower your unarmed strikes.
An item can only have one entwined rune inscribed on it. You must attune to an item bearing an entwined rune in order to use the rune’s properties. 

> The knowledge of crafting legendary runes was lost with the fall of the Imperium of Man and only those recovered from ruins and moldering crypts can be transcribed and then, by only the most skilled runesmiths. Some believe that elder elorii retain the knowledge necessary to create new legendary runes, though zealot Sarishans argue that these powerful runes come directly from His divine inspiration.
> If you wish to use legendary runes in your campaign, they should not be for sale in the village blacksmith shop. They should be found only among the truly wealthy or in the most ancient of fortresses. They should be given as special rewards to only higher level player characters. These items should be given out in much the same context as legendary magic items, and have powers consistent with very rare to legendary items. Like rare and very rare runes, only a single legendary rune may be inscribed in a single item, lest the item simply combust due to the immense magical forces trapped within it.


## Rune Stacking
Each rune creates its own unique pattern that cannot operate when combined with duplicates. If the same rune is inscribed on a single item multiple times, only the most powerful version of that rune is active even if there are other forms of that rune inscribed on the item.
This limitation also applies to effects that have limited number of uses. Those limits are accessed per item, not per rune, thus inscribing multiple copies of a rune onto an item will not allow you to bypass that limitation.
Several runes sheath the object in some form of energy (fire, frost, electricity, etc). An item may be sheathed in only one form of energy at a time; activating another such rune will just change the kind of energy surrounding the item.

## Rune Formulas
Much like magic items, runes require formulas for creation. A rune’s formula describes the intricate and delicate process of inscribing the specific pattern of the symbol on the item as well as the ritual required to enchant the rune with magical energy. A runesmith collects many formulas over time, and providing a runesmith with a formula they don’t have is a sure way to get into their good graces.
Since each rune comes in different rarities, the formula for creating a rune creates a specific rarity of that rune. A formula to create a thunder rune (uncommon) is different than one for creating a thunder rune (rare). Likewise, the formula for creating amalgamated, blessed and entwined runes is different than the formulas to create the usual versions of the runes in question. So a formula for a blessed necrotic rune (uncommon) is different than a formula for ad entwined necrotic rune (uncommon). No formulas exist for legendary runes; it is thought that the skill needed to create such things has vanished.
Creating a rune’s formula is the pinnacle of a runesmith’s art since it captures the unique combination of artistic and magical skill required to inscribe a rune in a way that others can reproduce, if they are skilled enough to understand the formula. In order to create the formula for a rune, a runesmith must have an example of the rune in question and spend twice the amount of gold and time it would cost 
to inscribe the rune. The rune that provided the basis of the formula is destroyed during this process, along with the item it is inscribed upon.

## Learning Runes
During their long training, runesmiths study over the formulas in their master’s collection and dedicate themselves to mastering the craft of inscribing runes. By committing the intricacies of a rune’s formula to memory, eventually a runesmith can learn how to inscribe that rune. Learning a rune in this way takes three times the normal amount of gold and time needed to inscribe it. During this time, the runesmith makes many attempts at creating the physical pattern of the rune and learning the ritual necessary to capture magical energy within its design.

## Erasing Runes
As part of their training, apprentice runesmiths are often called upon to erase a rune from an item, in preparation for a new one being inscribed. Erasing a rune takes the same amount of time it would to inscribe the rune. This is the best way to learn a rune; while unraveling its pattern and carefully releasing the stored magical energy, a runesmith can learn how to create the rune again. As the last step in erasing a rune, the runesmith must make an Intelligence (Arcana) check, with a DC determined by the rarity of the rune, as show in the table below. On a success, the rune is erased from the item, leaving an empty rune slot, and the runesmith has learned how to inscribe that rune. On a failure, the rune is erased but the runesmith wasn’t able to grasp the intricacies of how it was inscribed.

RUNE RARITY	INTELLIGENCE (ARCANA) DC
Uncommon	15
Rare	17
Very Rare	20
Legendary	23
Amalgamated	+2
Blessed	+1
Entwined	+3


> TRANSFERRING RUNES
> Most of the time, if you bring a runesmith an item bearing a rune they don't know they will be happy for the opportunity to learn it and then inscribe it for you at significant discount, if not for free. This process takes a great deal of time and there is always the risk that in the process of erasing the new rune, the runesmith will fail to fully understand it. Runesmiths have created this spell as a solution, allowing them to transfer a rune from one item to another but losing the chance to learn the rune in question. The usual cost for transferring a rune is half of what it would cost to transcribe it but some runesmiths will charge more if they are asked to transfer a rune they do not know. Some runesmiths may even refuse such a request.

Ammunition
Burrowing Arrow
Weapon (ammunition, arrow or bolt), uncommon
Description: These arrows appear as any others except that upon closer inspection, one may notice that the arrowhead is shaped in the form of a stinging insect of some kind. Magical in nature it is when these arrows taste blood that they seemingly come alive going into frenzy; shaking violently as they burrow into the victim’s flesh like some rabid animal.
History: Less than sixty years after the First Crusade came a second, this time against the Myrantians. The Coryani soon discovered that, while their foes were not as monstrous as the Infernals, they were formidable in many other ways. The Myrantians developed many magic items to combat the Coryani, including the first burrowing arrows, crafted in the form of desert wasps. The arrows were revealed in the first battle of Tigare, where the blood and devastation they caused, coupled with the fear-inducing spells of the Myrantian heretics, routed and destroyed the Legion of Bright Dawn.
Many of these arrows were recovered by Coryani during the Crusade, and then spread ; across the Known Lands.
Abilities/Effects: These pieces of magic ammunitions are typically found in batches of 5. Any living creature successfully struck with one of these pieces of ammunition must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw as the ammunition’s barbs rip at their flesh. A failed >; saving throw means that the ammunition	:v
has burrowed into the target’s flesh and has	1;
started to inflict extra damage on their internal	K
organs. At the beginning of their next turn,	g
the target suffers an additional ldlO piercing damage At the start of the victim’s third turn, the ammunition loses its magic and is ejected y T
from their body.	BURROWINC
ARROW
 
Humming Shot (Bullet)
Weapon (ammunition, bullet), uncommon
Description: Once fired, humming shots vibrate intensely as they speed towards their targets, making a strange yet melodic humming sound. Upon impact, the shot releases the stored sonic energy, causing devastating damage to the target struck.
History: “They sound like the soft serenade of a loving mother humming their baby to sleep, but strike with the destructive force of a razor-sharp gladius through your heart." — The Old Centurion

Maggot Arrows
Weapon (ammunition, arrow or bolt), uncommon

History: These dull black arrows or bolts are forged from tainted metal recovered from the Blighted Mire and other fetid areas such as the ruined cities in the Kraldjur Morass. Typically used by Cancerese assassins, these arrowheads were brought to devastating effect against the invading Milandisian armies during the Heretic War. Most credit the number of ill and wounded soldiers for having stalled the offensive and blunted the initial spear-like thrusts made into Canceri.
Abilities/Effects: When you successfully strike a living creature with this magic ammunition, they must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be infected with sight rot. Other version of this ammunition exist that infect their targets with different diseases.

Battle-Harness of the Manticore
Weapon (tail bracer), rare (requires attunement)
Description: This tail bracer is designed to be used by a creature with a long, thick tail such as a ss’ressen. It is fashioned after the spiked tail of a manticore and consists of a sheath around the tail, and a bundle of six spikes.
History: This spiked tail bracer was not developed until after the Black Talon egg clutch settled in Milandir. Among the clutch’s finest rangers was Tothiss, whose tail was strong and aim was true. When nearby Milandisian villages were attacked by a manticore, she rushed to give aid. For three days and nights she tracked the beast, and finally fought the 
manticore in its own den. The battle was fierce, and though the manticore perished, Tothiss was crippled and withered by the beast’s poison. No longer able to protect her Clutch, Tothiss turned to crafting, and in memory of the awesome tail of the manticore she created the first battle-harness so that her brethren might wield its deadly sting.
Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Due to the presence of spikes, you may choose to deal either bludgeoning or piercing damage when you use this weapon in melee. Furthermore, as a ranged attack you may launch one of the spikes at targets within 60 feet, dealing 1d10 points of piercing damage. The bracers have 6 spikes; if you fire all six spikes the bracer only deals bludgeoning damage until all of the spikes are regrown. The weapon regenerates 1d4 spikes daily at dawn.
The Blade of Natus
Weapon (shortsword), legendary (requires attunement)
Description: A black iron shortsword, is pitted and corroded, exuding a sense of fear and repulsiveness when looked upon.
History: Far to the west is the city-state of Natus, or as it’s more commonly known, the Tyrant City of the Dead. Here, the Tyrant Natus rules a virtual necropolis, populated solely by his deadly sect of holy assassins known as the Breath of Natus. While the lower echelons of the cult are made up of the living, the true terrors of this group are the undead leaders, those who have honed their skill of bestowing the Sacred Death for centuries. These few hallowed slayers wield a blade of Natus, offering up each and every life they take as a sacrifice for Neroth, the God of the Dead.
Abilities/Effects: You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic sword. Additionally, if you roll a 20 on your attack roll or deal sneak attack damage with this sword, you may force your target to make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or suffer an additional 2d10 necrotic damage while you gain an equal amount of temporary hit points. If you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with any attack by this weapon the target is instantly slain and you gain 20 temporary hit points. Temporary hit points granted by this weapon remain for 1 hour, during which time this weapon glows with an unholy red light. Additionally, anyone slain by the blade is reanimated as a zombie on their following turn, under the command of the wielder of the blade. Only one such zombie can be reanimated at a time, although it is said that Natus wields a blade that can raise and command an army of undead. If a new zombie is created while one previously created by the blade still exists, the older zombie disintegrates into dust.
Lastly, if this sword is held by anyone who is not a member of the Nerothian assassin cult, the Breath of Natus, they suffer 3d10 rounds of necrotic damage every turn while holding it. 

Canceri Champion’s Blade
Weapon (greatsword), rare (requires attunement with an oath, see below)
Description: These long, graceful swords are black in color, a property of the ore used to make the steel of the blade, and inscribed with benedictions to the three grim gods worshipped by the Cancerese.
History: These are blades granted to the most respected champions of Canceri in a ceremony officiated by the Dark Apostate.
Here, with the entire ruling Nihang Council in attendance, the litany of the champion’s accomplishments is read aloud to great acclaim. Finally, after an oath of loyalty is made, the blade is bestowed and the champion is given a holy quest to fulfil. Should the champion ultimately fail in completing their quest, their life is forfeit as the blade fills them with necrotic energy, killing them and trapping their soul with the sword itself.
Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magical sword; all damage dealt by this weapon is both slashing and necrotic. Every time you reduce a target to 0 hit points with this weapon you gain ldlO temporary hit points, which remain for 1 minute before they fade away. To become attuned to one of these blades you must swear a Sarishan oath of loyalty to the Church of the Dark Triumvirate.
The attunement process for this weapon also includes a holy quest that the wielder must accomplish. Should the wielder either violate their oath or fail in completing their quest, the weapon will flood their body with necrotic energy, dealing necrotic damage equal to twice their hit point maximum. This damage bypasses all resistances and immunities. If this effect kills the wielder, their soul is trapped within the weapon.
A soul trapped in this fashion is unable to pass on to the afterlife but can telepathically communicate with whoever becomes attuned to the weapon next. If the trapped soul can convince a wielder of the weapon to complete their failed quest. If this happens, the trapped soul is immediately released to the afterlife. If there is a soul trapped in the weapon when another wielder fails in their quest, the trapped soul is utterly destroyed and the soul of the most recent wielder becomes trapped in the weapon.
 
Capharran War Glaive
Weapon (glaive), rare (requires attunement)
Description: The haft of this weapon is solid oak, polished to a golden sheen. The blade is forged from magically hardened silver etched with fine silver tracery.
History: These war glaives are crafted for the honor guard of Capharran nobility, and are retained by these guards after their retirement. After generations, some have found their way through inheritance, gift, or seizure, throughout the League of Princes. Each is individually named, and the history of these glaives is highly honored by their bearers. Many claim the most ancient glaives were crafted in the Sky Kingdoms, but others doubt this, pointing out that the first recorded glaive was crafted by Naphthala val’Sungha, personal bodyguard to the Prince of Capharra in the third century. The consensus of most scholars is that Naphthala created the first of these items, though the Kio vehemently disagree.
Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Additionally, while wielding this glaive, you may spend your reaction when attacked in melee to grant yourself or an adjacent ally a +2 bonus to AC against the triggering attack. You must be aware of the incoming attack to use this ability.
Culdari “Final Repose”
Weapon (war scythe), legendary (requires attunement by a follower of Neroth)
Description: Culdari, called “Final Repose”, is the holy scythe said to have been once employed by the Valinor, the Hand of Neroth. This legendary weapon appears to be a jet¬black scythe, made of a wood never seen upon the surface of Arcanis. The entire haft is etched in hymns to Neroth, the symbols making serpentine patterns along its length. Pure silver was used to fill each symbol, creating a stark contrast to the dark handle. The top of the haft is mounted with a large skull and from its open mouth projects the silvery-steel scythe blade.
History: With the fall of the Imperium of Man, the god Illiir feared for the His children. He looked about and found the Celestial Giants waging a losing battle against the True Dragons and their wyrms. Illiir struck a deal with these giants saying, “Watch over my people, be unto them as protectors and guardians, and I shall save your people"
Desperate, the giants agreed and with the bargain struck and the Valinor, the servants of the Gods, took to the skies once more. Titanic battles raged across the continent, with the less powerful wyrms falling quickly to the valinoric host. But the wyrms had numbers on their side, as well as the devastating power of the True Dragons of Arcanis. In 

the end, the Valinor had to combine their powers, slaying a few of these forces of nature while only able to bind the most powerful of these Dragons into a dreamless slumber. Their own hosts decimated, the Valinor looked across the continent and saw that one last True Dragon remained; its name was Luqun’qun’ovn, and it fell to the Hand of Neroth to face the beast alone.
The titanic battle leveled mountains and changed the course of mighty rivers, with neither gaining the advantage. Finally, suffering horrific wounds from Culdari’s long blade, Luqun’qun’ovn fell from the sky.
The Hand of Neroth was so in awe of the Dragon, that decided to grant the beast the God of the Dead’s blessing and make the undead Dragon its steed. Unfortunately for the Valinor, it made the mistake of thinking the creature cowed by its defeat. Upon its resurrection, the Dragon swallowed the Valinor whole, entrapping it within its belly before taking flight upon tattered wings.
The surviving Valinor arrived in time to see their brother, the Hand of Neroth, reaching for them through the Dragon’s ribcage that now served as his prison, pleading for help. But the Host was too battered and weakened to pursue and battle the now Undead Dragon. Shaken by the loss, the winged angels took flight, leaving the scythe, Culdari forgotten and unclaimed on the battlefield.
Abilities/Effects: You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic scythe. It has the following additional properties.
Dragon Slayer: When you hit a dragon or ssethric creature with this weapon, the creature takes an additional 3d6 damage.
Bow to the Lord of Tombs:
As an action, you can gain control of any undead creature you can see for 24 hours. Undead you control follow your commands as if you had created them with the create undead spell, but the maximum total CR of undead you can control is equal to twice your proficiency bonus.
Sentience: Culdari is a sentient weapon with an Intelligence of 13, a Wisdom of 17 and a Charisma of 14. It has hearing and darkvision out to 120 feet. The item can communicate telepathic ally with and knows all the languages of whomever is attuned to it.
Personality: Culdari was once wielded by the Hand of Neroth; it does not suffer fools 
lightly. It is imperious and demanding but also dedicated to its purpose — protecting humanity. It is convinced that the best way to do this is to destroy ever dragon, including such draconic entities as Jeggal Sag and The Fire Dragon. Culdari tends to forget that most mortals cannot withstand such challenges. It is a stern taskmaster but it does have the best interests of humanity at heart
A conflict will occur if a dwarf, giant, ssethric, or ss’ressen attempts to attune with Culdari. Also, taking actions that would jeopardize humanity as a whole will prompt a conflict between the weapon and its wielder.
See Chapter Nine for the rules and properties of a war scythe.
Cutlass of the Buccaneer
Weapon (cutlass), uncommon
Description: This cutlass is a short, heavy blade, slightly curved, made for slashing through rigging and chopping into foes. The polished blade is unadorned but the hilt is heavily gilded in gold and adorned with seed pearls. The cutlass' thick, basket hilt is carven in relief with images of dolphins, fishes and other sea life. The sharkskin hilt provides unsurpassed grip and the leaden pommel is stamped with the holy symbol of Yarris, the Lord of the Seas.
History: The high seas are home to merchant and
miscreant alike; a place where fortunes are won and lost by fire and by sword.
No other region of the Known Lands is more famous for the depredations of seafaring travelers than the Pirate Isles. Many infamous corsairs have swept out of this region on fast sails to harry the coastlines of more civilized nations.
Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Additionally, the wielder may place the cutlass on a flat surface and utter the command word. The cutlass will then rotate until the point faces true north, a boon to all sailors who ply fog-shrouded coasts.
See Chapter Nine for the rules and properties of a cutlass.
Despair
Weapon (war scythe), very rare (requires attunement by an undead creature or worshiper of Neroth)
Description: This profane weapon was crafted by the Lich- Lord Hegrish val’Mordane of Sohbuk from the bones of priests from the Mother Church of Coryan.
History: Few creatures have shaped the history of Canceri like Hegrish val’Mordane, the longest serving Dark Apostate in Cancerese history thanks to his 
undead nature. During the Heretic Wars, some murmured that a Dark Apostate who sat on his throne while others fought for him was a weakling, speaking with fondness of Arthmoor val’Virdan’s famous death on the front lines. In response Hegrish unveiled Despair, crafted through his own knowledge of arcane arts and calculated to make him appear as Neroth himself on the battlefield, where he reaped the lives of many Milandisians. The scythe was lost after Hegrish’s assassination, and has not been seen since his return.
Abilities/Effects: You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage when attacking with this magic scythe. When you roll a 20 on an attack roll with this weapon, the target of your attack has their hit point maximum reduced by 2d10.
See Chapter Nine for the rules and properties of a war scythe.
Devil King’s Lash
Weapon (whip), legendary (requires attunement)
Description: This is a long black whip that at first glance appears to be made from tightly braided strips of black leather. Closer inspection reveals the leather to be roughly textured, even scaled, which seems to writhe and recoil under the touch of mortals. Woven into the braided strips are hooks and barbs, fashioned from human bone fragments and designed to flay the flesh from the living with each stroke. At the base of the whip’s blood-stained handle is a human skull.
While anyone can wield this weapon, its true powers are only evident to its real masters, those whose blood courses with the taint of Infernal blood.
History: During the Time of Terror the mankind was pitted against foul hordes from the Abyss. Hundreds of thousands died during that time as the bloody conflict raged across the Known Lands.
The blood of the innocent paid for the eventual decimation of the endless invading forces of Infernals and their generals, each armed with terrible artifacts from their blasted Realm.
One such item is the horrid fiery whips used by the Devil Kings to drive forward the Abyssal ranks. Some were taken as trophies of war, while most were confiscated and destroyed by the priests that accompanied the mortal host, assuring that such relics would not corrupt future generations.
Sadly, not all were accounted for and these lashes keep turning up in the hands of madmen and butchers.
 
Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Additionally, if you are tainted with infernal blood, the bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +2 and this weapon exhibits the following additional abilities:
Wicked Strikes: The whip deals an additional 2d6 fire damage.
Scorching Haze: As an action, you may project an aura of fear around you for 1 minute. All creatures within 30 feet of you have disadvantage on attack rolls. Creatures with resistance or immunity to fire damage are immune to this effect. Once this ability is used you may not use it again until midnight, or until you roll a 20 on an attack roll with this weapon, whichever comes first.
Duelists’ Surprise
Weapon (Any melee weapon), uncommon (no bonus), rare (+1)
Description: A favorite among hot-headed young nobles, and other miscreants of a more dubious nature, this miniature blade, complete with kidskin leather grip, is a
mere two inches long, but with a flick of the wrist becomes a full-size sword.
History: The first of these weapons was created not by a duelist, but by an assassin during the Shadowed Age. Fin Raghnaid might be no more than a legend, but it is said that he visited the fractured ourts of warlords and petty despots, entangling himself in their intrigues and, when necessary, producing a sword from what appeared to be thin air to slay a rival. A limited number of these swords were crafted through the ages, but it was not until the great dueling schools of Savona were founded that they became popular. No longer a weapon of assassins, those dueling schools with a reputation for deadliness over honor popularized these items, and now they can be found in wide variety.
Abilities/Effects: All duelists’ surprise weapons are magic weapons, but only the rare variety grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls. Both versions of the weapon can be changed from their miniature version to full-sized and back again as a bonus action. While miniature, these weapons are quite simple to conceal and grant advantage on your ability rolls to hide them. Even if found the miniature blades are taken to be simple trinkets.
It is possible to find examples of these weapons made of materials other than standard materials, such as adamantine, Sarishan steel and silver. 
Earthbreaker
Weapon (Tralian hammer), legendary (requires attunement)
Description: The head of this enchanted Tralian hammer was chiseled out of a single block of black basalt, wrapped in bands of gold, while its long haft is made of ironwood.
History: Adelinda val’Tensen was short of stature, but large in spirit. When she joined the cantons, she could barely lift a halberd, and her chain shirt fell to her knees. Taller Milandisians snickered, but she dedicated herself to training every muscle in her body to perfection. Soon she could best any canton in physical combat, and with their support she sought entry into the Tralian Knights. She was rejected due to her height alone. Undaunted, she asked that they grant her combat to prove herself. They set her against their mightiest knight to teach her a lesson. She brought him to the ground with a single blow. To celebrate her knighthood, she commissioned Earthbreaker as her personal weapon. The tales of Adelinda effortlessly wielding ^ Tralian hammer far taller than she / only added to her legend.
Abilities/Effects: You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magical adamantine weapon. This hammer has 3 charges. As an action, you may use 1 charge to slam the hammer’s head onto the ground to create shockwave before you.

As an action, you may use 2 charges and slam the hammer’s shaft against the ground summon an earth elemental. Thi/ elemental appears and fights by your side, moving to attack anyone who attacks you in melee or with a range weapon if they are within 30 feet. If your attackers are more than 30 feet away from _ you, your elemental will instead grant you half- ^ cover as it interposes its body between you and your would-be attackers.
This hammer regains ld3 expended charges daily at dawn
 
Emerald Scale Tail Bracer
Weapon (tail bracer), uncommon (requires attunement)
Description: This leather bracer is designed to strap onto the tail of a ss’ressen. It is covered with spikes attached at different angles. Iron plates are sewn in to give it extra weight.
History: The Emerald Scale egg clutch, are under constant threat of extermination by their naga rulers due to their forbidden worship of Kassegore. To stave ofl^ disaster without compromising their faith, the Emerald Scales crafted new magical items for their egg clutch, including the first tail bracers. When next they entered battle, these new items allowed them to dominate the enemies of Ssethregore, and made the nagas take notice. Already leery of exterminating the Emerald Scales, the nagas also wanted tail bracers for their other ss’ressen warriors. As more clutches devoted themselves to the Varn, the naga allowed them access to the new weapons as well. When the Black Talons left the Ssethregoran Empire they took several tail bracers with them, making them now common in both the Kraldjur Morass and the Sulfur Marsh.
Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Due to its construction, it deals an additional ld4 piercing damage
EMERALD SCALE
TAIL BRACER

Firecrux Flamberge
Weapon (greatsword), very rare (requires attunement)
Description: This flamberge has a blade that is molten gold color.
History: These fiery greatswords were created in the volcanic forges of the Erdukeen Nierites centuries ago and bestowed upon a long succession of holy champions.
An elite contingent of Nierite warriors, known as the Warriors of the Eternal Flame, spearheaded the invasion of the recently freed Sword of the Heavens into neighboring Milandir with the aim of retaking the First City. Most were killed or missing during the Night of Silence, when the entire army was attacked and decimated by an unknown force.
Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic greatsword. As a bonus action, you may speak the command word to cause flames to erupt and engulf the blade. These flames shed bright light in a 40-foot radius and dim light for an additional 40 feet. While the sword is ablaze, it deals an extra 2d6 fire damage to any target it hits. The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop or sheathe the sword.
Blessings from the Lord of Flame: If you are a
divine spellcaster dedicated to Nier, the weapon deals 2d8 fire damage while it is ablaze, instead of 2d6. In addition, if you roll a 20 while attacking a water elemental or some other creature with a connection to the elemental plane of water, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be instantly destroyed.
Flail of Kihuk-Mak
Weapon (unique), rare (requires attunement)
Description: This intimidating heavy flail has three spiked balls tethered to a haft of ironwood by barbed chains. In darkness, the flail glows with a malevolent aura illuminating everything within 20-feet in a halo of diseased green light.
History: Kihuk-Mak was a dark-kin of black reputation beyond the Godswall, where he served as an agent of Uhxbractit’s
 
dictatorship. Enemies of the state were slaughtered by his flail, crafted for him by Uhxbractit’s own forge master. The weapon drank deeply from the blood of the innocent, until one rebel from Bastion unleashed the Word of Xabal in his dying moments. Kihuk-Mak’s compatriots were destroyed, and Kihuk-Mak fell near death. When he recovered, the purity he had felt shook him to his core. In that instant, he realized his taint and the evils he had been party to. A thousand pricks of conscience over the years coalesced into determination. He founded a resistance against his former masters, and his vile flail became a symbol of rebellion against the Infernals.
Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic reach weapon. This weapon deals an additional 2d8 necrotic damage to infernals or creatures with the infernal taint, such as dark-kin.
Forestbane
Weapon (battleaxe), legendary (requires attunement)
Description: This axe consists of double axe heads and a long handle of seasoned ironwood oak, ideal for hacking with two hands.
History: In 1025 I.C. Myrantian cultists of Mahememnun approached Kanutus Lupus, a member of the heretical group known as the Black Druids of Jannyal. This group was warred upon almost to extinction by the priestesses of Saluwe and the val’Dellenov family. The death of so many of his order, as well as being prohibited to practice their faith so enraged Kanutus that he vowed vengeance on the Mother Church and the val’Dellenovs. The Myrantians played on his hatred, coaxing Kanutus to craft forestbane, making copies for him and the few remaining druids and embark on a personal war of vengeance against the pristine glades of the empire. For a year Kanutus and his band ravaged the land, evading agents of the val’Dellenovs, and destroying many sacred groves in the process. Though he was eventually arrested and executed, many of the forestbane blades were never recovered. His brief rampage served the Myrantians’ purpose, distracting the people of Empire so they did not notice the preparations being made for the Abessian rebellion.
Abilities/Effects: You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls while using this magic weapon. While holding this weapon, you may use an action to cast blight (save DC 16) or gain 2dl0 temporary hit points which remain until you complete a long rest.

Gauilfur
Weapon (Warhammer), rare (requires attunement)
Description: This two-handed warhammer is beautifully gilded with gold script about its head and throughout the long handle.
History: The dwarven warhammer was a weapon of legend, featured prominently in the songs and stories of the enclaves. For centuries, however, no truly great warhammers had been made, beyond the standard magical enchantments any human smith could duplicate. That changed with the return of the Sword of the Heavens and the rise of master smith Berenike of Nol Dappa.
As the Erdukeens were experiencing a renewed passion for their history, so Berenike experienced a renewed passion for hers. Already a talented master smith, she was determined to create a warhammer to equal the legendary weapons of old. After a year of work, she created Gauilfur, which first saw use at the Battle of Sicaris. Since that time young dwarves from many enclaves have sought to apprentice with Berenike, hoping to rediscover the art of the dwarven warhammer.
Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic warhammer. While you hold this weapon, you possess resistance to fire damage.

Description: This simple hammer is unadorned, but for a single, complex rune stamped on either side of the head.
History: A Coryani smith named Geraccio, owned this magical tool renowned for its ability to perfectly temper metal, until it was stolen from him by a band of thieves.
It is possible that Geraccio made this item, but various dwarven master smiths claim they were the original creator. After the hammer was stolen, it resurfaced in Tir Betoq for a period of time before being disappearing. Its current whereabouts are unknown, but it can be identified by the single rune stamped onto either side of the head of this otherwise plain hammer.
Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magical hammer. The hammer can be used as smith’s tools. Upon command, the hammer can be used like a forge, heating the metal it is working to the perfect tempering temperature of that material. This allows for the creation of simple metal items, such as horseshoes, nails, or buckles, in one- quarter the normal time, or complex metal items, such as blades, armor, and locks, in one-half the normal time.
Additionally, the hammer grants the wielder advantage on all ability checks made to create items out of metals. This property of the hammer does not have any effect on the damage it deals in combat. The hammer magically heats the metal it works; it does not generate heat itself.

History: Calliste Obcasus loved her grandfather, who doted on her, protected her during the uncertainty of the Shadowed Age, and taught her many secrets. He raised her in the worship of Neroth, and she dedicated herself to the god of death. Then the val’Dellenov lords came and destroyed her grandfather, for he was blessed by Lord Neroth with unlife. Calliste blamed the local priests of Neroth for betraying him, and joined a sect that worshiped Neroth’s undead aspect. She helped unleash a plague of undeath on Balantica, then watched in horror as she learned that few undead matched her memories of her grandfather. They were monsters.

History: Ko Jajani is an influential merchant operating out of the trade city of Mil Takara, one of the larger and wealthier settlements in the southern Hinterlands. He has a reputation for being a collector of rare treasures and unusual antiquities plucked from the ruins littering the countryside. His most recent acquisition was greendeath, a magical blade of unknown origin discovered a few years back in the northern reaches of his homeland. The merchant procured the blade from an unscrupulous treasure hunter named the Silt Fox, a Khur Gi woman, one of the Yhing hir tribes. While she refused to disclose where she found the unsettling blade, her frequent excursions in the haunted Canyons of Zhu point to that as greendeath’s point of origin.

Any time you roll a 20 on an attack made with this weapon, the target struck suffers 2dl0 poison damage and must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute.
Harmony
Weapon (longsword, unique), very rare (requires attunement)
Description: This fine weapon is forged from Altherian steel, with a large green sapphire engraved with the image of a harp sitting upon the edge of a sword on its pommel.
Its twisted swept hilt and cage has been forged to look like twisted thorn filled vines. The blade itself has been polished to a mirror finish, across which is the word Harmony in Ancient Altharin.
History: Nia Samanya, finest bard of the ancient Tenecian Empire, performed at the dedication of the floating city of Khafre. So fine was her performance that the Council of Wisdom offered her a boon. She asked for a sword, 
warning that in the shadow of Khafre all would soon require swords. The Council did not like this answer, but unwilling to lose face they had their finest artificers create Harmony. Nia’s request proved prophetic, and she often used her blade in defense of fallen Althre. After her death, the Council of Wisdom retained the blade, until it was taken by the Coryani after their conquest. It came into the hands of Savano Lazarath, the warrior-bard of Coryan.
He disappeared with Harmony in the tenth century while eluding Harvesters.

Heart’s Fang
Weapon (longsword), rare (requires attunement)
Description: Looking more like a butcher’s cleaver than a longsword, heart’s fang is a crude looking weapon, made of black iron with red sigils etched along its blade. The hilt is of simple bronze, while the bronze pommel is set with a large ruby.
History: According to legend, heart’s fang was the weapon used by the Gar Ormal chieftain during the First War of Extinction against the Issori. After their betrayal at the hands of their allies, the ssethrics, the blade disappeared from history, until it a recently discovered eloran scroll made mention of numerous wars against the gar, where this sword figured prominently. Centuries would pass before it was once again seen, again in the hands of a gar, as these bestial men waged war against the Imperium of Man. In modern times, the chieftain of the marauding Gar Tiche, whose wanderings have them raiding towns and caravans from the western edge of the Corlathian Mountains to the shores of the Lauriol Sea, has been seen wielding a weapon matching Heart’s Fang’s description. This tale contradicts the infamous Ig of the Many Tongues, who claims that heart’s fang is in the hands of a very dangerous warlord of the Gar Dahl, the People of Iron, in far off Quagga. 
The blade is said to remember every betrayal and sworn enemy of the gar tribes and the spirit within vows to take vengeance upon every member of that race, until they are no more. The spirit demands that blade be heated white hot and then quenched, over and over again, in the hearts of a score of the race it has sworn to destroy
This, along with the stories of others possessing Heart’s Fang, lead scholars to conclude that there must be more than one copy of the blade. Ig of the Many Tongues agrees. He believes that while each gar tribe may have made copies of their own, the original Heart’s Fang, the one wielded by the extinct Gar Ormal chieftain, is the one held by the Gar Dahl warlord, for it is covered in sigils and said to hunger for the blood of all that have hunted the gar over the ages.
Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit a val or other creature with celestial blood, the creature takes an extra 3d6 slashing damage. Furthermore, this weapon glows a dull red when any val or creature with celestial blood approaches within 60 ft. of the wielder.

Kelisar, “Serpent Eater”
■■ Weapon (longsword), legendary (requires attunement by an elorii)
Description: Kelisar is an elegant single-edged
longsword. The blade has a series of runes etched
upon it. The golden hilt wraps elegantly around
the wielder’s hand forming an intricate basket
portraying a mongoose attacking a serpent.
Kelisar’s pommel is adorned with a flawless emerald of the deepest green, its perfect balance is apparent to anyone lucky enough to hold this magnificent sword in their hands.
History: Kelisar or serpent eater in the Eloran language, is an ancient elorii blade forged by Auros, the legendary elorii warrior that slew the ssanu archmage Ss’koreth. After the elorii overthrew their scaled overlords, the elorii craftsman Ferelas, affixed its distinctive hilt to the blade. Kelisar hung in a place of honor in Belestor, removed only in times of great need, such as the various Ssethric incursions occurring every few centuries. Kelisar was last used in battle against humans during the Great Betrayal, where the reborn hero Auros used it to wound a Valinor. It is not known if the famed blade was taken with retreating elorii forces or if it fell into the hands of their human foes.

Lance of the Errant Knight
Weapon (lance), rare
Description: Crafted from wood gathered in the Faerdwalden, these lances are often carved with mythical creatures, such as unicorn, or other horned animals, such as the narwhal.
History: The woodsmen of the Faerdwalden have made intricately carved lances since before the founding of the Milandisian League, but it was during the reign of Oswald val’Inares, the Usurper, that these works of art became all the 
rage in the court of Naeraanth. Oswald II granted an enchanted lance carved with a unicorn to Ermingild Traudottir, a knight sworn to his service whom he favored. Ermingild secretly loathed the line of the Usurper, but was bound by her duty to the king. She served Oswald II until the end, then exiled herself in penance and wandered the land as a knight errant. As the Faerdwalden lances, seen as symbols of the Usurper’s reign, fell out of style at court, her noble actions brought them a different reputation, and many knights errant now seek out similarly enchanted lances to follow in her footsteps.
Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magical lance; this bonus increases to +2 when you are directly protecting the defenseless. Additionally, any time you are engaged in mounted combat this weapon grants you and your mount a +1 bonus to AC.
Lantas Dalo:
Cleaver of Trolls
Weapon (longsword, unique), very rare (requires attunement)
Description: Lantas Dalo appears to be the perfect longsword with a heavy, over weighted tip to smash through the rocky carapace of Singarthan Trolls. The handle is carved from straight-grained ironwood and the pommel capped with a replica of a gauntleted fist.
Dwarven runes cover the blade; retelling the tale of the troll invasion of Solanos Mor, while a multitude of small diamonds encrust the hilt causing the hilt to sparkle in the light.
History: Lantas Dalo was forged a century ago by Master Smith Elebac of Solanos Mor. At the time of its forging, the city fell under siege by a horde of Singarthan Trolls that swept down out of the Corlathian Mountains and into the numerous tunnels that riddle that mountain range.
The siege lasted for one hundred days until the valiant defenders of the City of Shameful Penance finally drove off or destroyed the troll host, but not before suffering heavy casualties. Master Elebac soon learned that his eldest son had fallen in the battle. Heartbroken, Elebac swore vengeance and returned to the unfinished sword in his forge with unbridled determination and fury.
When the blade neared completion, Elebac had the city guard bring a live troll before him. This Singarthan Troll was the warlord Thragris, captured on the field of battle and imprisoned before his broken body could recover. As 
the last hammer blow rang upon the blade, Thragris was set free and Elebac turned to face the unfettered Troll lord. “My vengeance begins at the source!” shouted Elebac as he waded into battle, the sword’s blade still glowing red-hot. Thragris never stood a chance.
Afterwards, Elebac pulled the now cool sword from the ruined body of the troll and looked upon the finished blade. He raised the sword above his head and, in a soft voice, christened the new blade Lantas Dalo, the Cleaver of Trolls. Elebac then strode across the cavern to his eldest daughter, Betra, and presented the sword to her hilt first. “Duty binds me here to continue my craft, but take up this sword my daughter, and avenge your brother and all the others who fell to these beasts,” said Elebac. And with that, Elebac strode back to his forge to continue perfecting his craft, while Betra girded for war and left Solanos Mor on her own crusade.
Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage when attacking with this magic weapon.
All hit point damage dealt by this weapon may only be regained through a short or long rest, rather than by regeneration, magic, or other means. When used against trolls, this weapon heats itself white hot and deals an extra 2d6 fire damage. This sword glows blue when within 60 feet of any type of troll.
Lion of Winter
Weapon (longsword, unique), legendary (requires attunement by the head of the val’Tensen family)
Description: This longsword’s blade is ice blue, as if made of solidified cold, with an elegant pattern etched along the flat side. The elaborate cross guard is fashioned to resemble a lion’s head, complete < with fur to simulate its mane.
History: This longsword has been in the hands of the val’Thnsen family since the days of the Imperium of Man. But since the sundering of the val’Tensen line after the secession of Milandir from the Coryani Empire, the sword has made its displeasure known by killing anyone attempting to take the blade from its scabbard who was not the rightful leader of that family.
The governor of the Coryani province of Ulfila, Augustos Titus val’Thnsen, determined to humiliate his separatist cousins by wielding the blade and thus proving that they were no longer a part of the family had his blood freeze in his veins upon taking the sword from its sheath. Emboldened, the newly crowned Duke 
of Moratavia took possession of the sword and suffered the same fate when he attempted to wield the sword. Fearful that none were now worthy of claiming the sword, it was given to the monastic Order of the Blade, where it will remain until the true head of the family comes forth to claim it.
Abilities/Effects: You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls with this magic weapon. When you hit a creature with this sword, the target takes an extra 2d8 cold damage. This weapon ignores all resistance to slashing and cold damage. In addition, as an action while holding this weapon, you can cast wall of ice (save DC 17). Once you use this ability, you cannot use it again until the next dawn.
Curse: If this blade is wielded by any other than the rightful head of the val’Tensen family, the wielder dies instantly. No save is allowed. This curse may not be removed through any known method.
Mastbreaker
Weapon (bardiche), rare (requires attunement)
Description: This gruesome bardiche has been pieced together using the masts and metalwork from the first ship the pirate captain Yacobin Bike plundered.
History: Most pirates from the Pirate Isles refrain from preying on each other, but not so Yacobin Bike. He was a boy when his crew was betrayed to the Coryani by fellow pirates. Yacobin escaped execution and swore all the world would be his target, particularly fellow pirates. He stole his first ship, then stole a better one. The first time he plundered a fellow pirate he ripped apart the mast and metalwork of her ship, and reforged them into a bardiche. Now he is a legend to be feared. His swift ship draws near under cover of darkness or fog, and then Yacobin himself swims silently aboard. With mastbreaker he cripples the ship, leaving it vulnerable as his first mate pilots Yacobin’s vessel to attack. He takes no prisoners, sinking ships with all hands after he has plundered the cargo.
Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. If you use this weapon to destroy an object, break through a door, barricade, or other barrier, mastbreaker’s bonus increases to +3 and deals an additional 2d8 force damage.

Moon Blade
Weapon (longsword), very rare (requires attunement by a val’Dellenov)
Description: This curved blade, meant to represent the crescent moon, shimmers and glows like a moonbeam.
History: The val’Dellenov family, being scions of the goddess Saluwe, feel a deep connection to nature and the beasts that roam the land. Many can tap into the power of their heritage, calling forth many aspects of animals to aid them. When learning to use their abilities, they are taught to always retain control, but a few are unable to resist the dark lure of giving into the more savage side of nature and revel unabashedly in it.
One of the most infamous killers in the empire was Luciana Titus val’Dellenov, a woman who allowed the primal urges of the wild to overwhelm her, hunting down her fellow man as a wolf hunts prey. She was eventually captured and tried by the Mother Church for heresy, after which she was promptly burnt alive. Various random acts of murder and mayhem soon followed, which were blamed on rampaging humanoid wolves that turned back into normal humans at first light. Many point to Luciana’s death curse as the root of this lycanthropic scourge. Altherian scholars scoff at the idea that lycanthropy is a curse that can be spread through bites from the infected, and believe instead this is a blood curse aimed at those who witnessed Luciana’s death, which was passed down to their descendants. If they are correct, then there may be many thousands of potential victims, as the execution was conducted just outside the walls of Grand Coryan, with many thousands in attendance.
Others believe that the blood curse is perpetuated by a secretive group known as the Conclave of the Claw that believes that unleashing the beast within all of us is the true representation of Saluwe’s will.
Seeing this as a stain upon their family honor, the val’Dellenov train members of the family to be hunt down those afflicted by this curse, just as they pursue other shapechangers, such as the wererats that infest cities.
Due to the inherent dangers involved in the slaying a shapechanger, these hunters are issued a moon blade. Within the Golden Boughs of Saluwe is a shrine to a little known aspect of Saluwe, the Lady of Moonlight. Here, Saluwean priestesses enact a ritual consecrating a blade on the first night that Viridis, the green moon, is full. The owner of the blade stands vigil throughout the night, which culminates when the blade is immersed in a hallowed reflecting pool as it catches the last of the moon’s glow. Retrieving it from the cool waters, the blade shimmers with the glow of a moonbeam, feeling almost weightless in the owner’s grasp. 
Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which increases to +2 when fighting shapechangers. Furthermore, the blade shimmers a pale green whenever any shapechanger, regardless of form, approaches within 60 feet.
Any shapechanger that is successfully struck with this weapon must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be forced to revert to their original form and be unable to shift form until the next dawn.
Finally, the blade can cause the tracks of shapechangers to shimmer with a pale moon-lit glow. This grants you advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks made to track shapechangers.
Screaming Sword
Weapon (longsword), legendary (requires attunement)
Description: The actual appearance of a screaming sword varies greatly; however, all incorporate a jagged piece of crystal. The type and color of the crystal depends on where the wailing stone was discovered. For example, green and blue crystals are common throughout the Corlathian Mountains, but Thandras, Givahi val’Ishi’s personal blade, was fashioned from a blood-red crystal. Regardless of the crystal used, these blades are magically hardened and sharpened to preserve their cutting edge. The design of the hilt is chosen by the creator, although most incorporate some type of geometric design that follows the shape of the bound crystal.
History: In the days immediately following the curse that turned Celestial Giants to the dwarves, they found that most souls passed on to oblivion when they died, though a few became trapped in crystal deposits near the enclaves where the dwarves gathered.
Val psions later discovered that these stones, charged with the energy of dwarven souls, could be tapped to power psionic items, though doing so released the soul within. Givahi val’Ishi of Enpebyn, a brilliant val artificer found a way of permanently sealing the energy within the stones. Givahi further refined this sealing technique to allow him to infuse his own power within the crystal alongside the soul energy, creating the first screaming sword in 123 I.C.
The techniques developed by Givahi vaFIshi spread quickly among the val, to the point where the dwarves demanded that all such stones be turned over
 
to them, so that they could be given a place of rest within the Chamber of Final Repose, leading to one of the few modern conflicts between the Solani dwarves and the Coryani Empire. All dwarves bear a great hatred towards anyone seen wielding one of these blades. Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you attack psionically awakened creatures or creatures whose natural attacks deal psionic damage, this bonus increases to +3. Also, whenever you make an attack using this weapon, all sentient creatures within 20 feet can telepathically “hear” the weapon moaning, muttering, and screaming in their minds; these noises do not cause any benefits or penalties, but most creatures find them unsettling and disturbing.
Psiscream: A screaming sword has 3 charges. While holding the weapon, as a bonus action you may expend 1 charge to force each creature in a 15-foot radius to make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 psychic damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and is not pushed.
This sword regains 1 charge daily at dawn.
Sea Rover
Weapon (scimitar), rare (requires attunement)
Description: This scimitar is crafted of Milandisian steel and has a crescent guard inlaid with mother-of-pearl and coral. Its hilt is wrapped in sharkskin to give it a strong grip, while the end of the pommel is set with a pure aquamarine gemstone.
History: Though many who craft this weapon in Savona and the League of Princes do not know its history, those in Naeraanth tell of Merireiks val’Ossan, the wild centurion who had as many disciplinary actions as he had awards of honor, who once wrestled a shark bare-handed, and who crafted Sea Rover with a Savonan artificer on a drunken dare. He was sent with the legions to quell the Eppion rebellion, and while stationed in Metra he fell in love with an Undir who shared his interest in artificing and the sea, and who learned the falchion’s secret. When the legion left Metra she declined to go with him, and after many more campaigns, Merireiks finally retired to Naeraanth. The original Sea Rover is still used by the Dolphin Guard.
Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While holding this falchion, you may stand on and move across any liquid surface as if it were solid ground (when crossing molten lava or some other dangerous surface, you can still take damage from heat or fumes). 
Shadow Mother
Weapon (longsword), legendary (requires attunement)
Description: This black longsword is unique in the fact that its matte black finish seems to drink up all light around it. The material does not rust or tarnish, and always appears to be the deepest possible black. The blade itself is forged with deep fullers carved into the blade to drain the blood of its victims.
History: Osvaldus Ephrem had one goal in life: Power. He
falsely joined the temple of Cadic to gain access to the Shadowstone, rumored to be a crystalized Valinor of the dark god. He stole the Shadowstone and crafted a sword to steal the essence of the Valinor and bind it to his own soul. But the Shadowstone was not a Valinor of Cadic. It was not a Valinor at all. It was an artifact of death beyond Osvaldus’s ability to control. That was when the Cadician assassins struck, putting down Osvaldus’s heresy, but not before he had finished his creation. They took Shadow Mother for further study, but the cursed blade overwhelmed the wielder, who slew several of his brethren before escaping.
Abilities/Effects: You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
When you hit with an attack using this weapon the target takes an additional ldlO necrotic damage with the wielder of the weapon suffering half of the necrotic damage dealt to the target.
Curse: This weapon is cursed, a fact that is revealed only when an identify spell is cast on the sword or you attune to it. Once attuned up, you feel a constant desire to use this weapon to kill others and must succeed at a DC 10+1 per character level Charisma saving throw to use any other weapon while you are bearing this weapon. To drop or stop being attuned to this weapon requires a DC 20 Charisma saving throw, with a failed save preventing the wielder from dropping the weapon and triggering a Rage per the Barbarian class ability.
Should the wielder of this weapon ever be reduced to 0 hit points or lower, their soul is pulled from their body into the blade. While in this form, the soul is still in control of the body— which is not considered to be an undead—but separate from it. Without the soul present in the body, it is now has resistance to healing effects, only being healed for half the amount rolled. While in this form, the body does not require food or drink, as the energy of the sword keeps it sustained.
 
While in this form, whenever shadow mother deals necrotic damage to a target, the wielder’s body is healed the full amount of the necrotic damage dealt. If the wielder of this blade does not kill another creature before midnight every day, the body of the wielder has its hit point maximum reduced by 5 as the magical connection to their body withers away. For each 5 hit points drained from the body, it begins to look increasingly skeletal until it looks little more than a desiccated mummy. At this point, should the body ever be reduced to 0 hit points by any means, the wielder is permanently killed and the soul is forever trapped in the sword.
Sickle Sword
of the Myrantian Lord
Weapon (khopesh), legendary
(requires attunement)
Description: The lapis-lazuli inlayed into the ivory hilt of this sickle is stained by the blood of the countless creatures slain by this hungry blade. Slightly tarnished and notched, the iron blade of this khopesh is still sharp.
History: This sword was created not by a Myrantian, but by Blasius Toranestus, Coryani governor of the province of Toranesta. He styled himself as one of the Phaerons of old, and commissioned Caecus val’Abebi, a Coryani artificer, to fashion him a weapon reminiscent of the royal khopesh held by the ruler of ancient Myrantis. Blasius’s love of all things Myrantian did not extend to its people, and his oppressed provincials eventually slew him with his own sickle sword. The sword was later stolen from Coryani custody and delivered anonymously to the new governor of Toranesta, still stained with Blasius’s blood. Each future Coryani governor found a similar khopesh delivered to them, as a warning, and a similar weapon is now held by the Phaeron of the Abessian Dominion.
Abilities/Effects: You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Any time you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with this weapon, the target is instantly killed. Additionally, when you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon, you may force the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or fall dead. Once used, this ability cannot be used again until the next dawn.
If this weapon is held by anyone who is not of Myrantian ethnicity, they suffer 3dl0 points of necrotic damage every turn while this weapon is held.
See Chapter Nine for the rules and properties of a khopesh. 
Spear of Wind and Wave
Weapon (spear), rare (requires attunement)
Description: This spear consists of a palm-wood haft set with a broad edged tip fashioned from magically hardened coral.

History: Spell spinner was discovered in the ruins under the First City by the Warrior Sage Vinas val'Mehan of the Emerald Society. Vinas was able to successfully date the blade's design back to the beginning of Imperium of Man, but the weapon’s powers remained largely a mystery to him until the expedition crossed paths with an ancient undead horror while returning to the surface. During the battle, the creature unleashed a series of destructive spells, one fired directly at Vinas' chest. Reflexively, he raised the blade to block the blow, and, to everyone’s amazement, deflected the eldritch bolt back, destroying the creature. From that point forth, the blade became a fixture at his side, but upon his death, Vinas ordered the blade be given to the Emperor of Coryan as a gift. The messenger and the blade never made it to Grand Coryan however, and Spell Spinner has been lost ever since.

History: The Hussuma were the taskmasters of ancient Yahssremore, generals who commanded vast elorii slave armies during the Wars of Extinction. These whips were given to them by their ssanu masters and used to deliver punishment to those elorii who failed to obey orders.

Addertongue
Weapon (blowgun), very rare
Description: Fashioned from the hollowed stem of a rare desert plant, the blowgun is about 4 feet in length and carven to resemble a serpent.
History: The Pengik have used their signature long blowguns from time immemorial.
Even before other humans came to Onara, Ichna’gi shamans would use the blowguns as instruments to emit strange droning sounds that carried messages for miles across the Flinterlands. But while many Pengik used darts tipped with 
deadly poisons in their blowguns, it was only during the Time of Terror that the first addertongue was created. The Ichna’gi shamans were reluctant to alter their traditional weapons, but they finally relented in order to counter the greater threats of the infernal-ruled world. Today addertongues are primarily found among shamans, though some warriors carry them as well, while others have been traded to outsiders.

Althares’ Gift
Weapon (flintlockpistol), very rare
Description: This flintlock pistol is engraved with benedictions to Althares, the God of Wisdom and Knowledge.
History: Altherians are never satisfied. Having learned the secrets of blastpowder, it was only a matter of time before they sought to maximize this gift. Pallas val’Abebi, a young artificer, stumbled upon the secret of this flintlock early in his career, and with the abandon of youth he developed it. While the Council of Wisdom acknowledged his craftsmanship, they felt that the weapon took Althares’ precious gift for granted, and would incur his wrath.
After the Battle of
Semar however, necessity forced the Altherians to reconsider Pallas’s creation. They have begun manufacturing Althares’gifts for the Shining Patrol and certain favored
 
others. It remains to be seen if Altheria will once again pay a price for such hubris.
Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. You may use your action to load this weapon and say a prayer to Althares. This causes the weapon to lose its loading property and allow it to be fired 1d4+1 times before needing to be reloaded. It only consumes one piece of ammunition and magically duplicates it for each shot. The GM should roll for the exact number of shots but only inform the wielder when they have run out. Once the weapon is out of shots, you may either fire it as a normal flintlock or use another action to invoke Althares’ blessing.
Bow of the Five Peoples
Weapon (longbow), very rare (requires attunement)
Description: Tassels of preserved leaves and fine runes decorate the ends of this birch bow.
History: The first of these bows were created by Arfeas, the renowned artificer of Malfea. These bows are given as high honors to elorii who prove themselves worthy, normally by slaying humans during the never-ending Malfelen War of Vengeance. Almost immediately the bows began appearing in Elonbe and Entaris as well.

Weapon (longbow), very rare (requires attunement)
Description: This eloran longbow is exquisitely crafted to resemble winged dragons and made of enchanted silver, giving it the flexibility of a normal wooden bow.
History: Among the elorii who fought on behalf of Yahssremore few were as feared as the Wyrm Riders, who rode their namesakes into battle and traveled in the company of the great wyrms. For this elite unit, the first silverbows were created by ssethric artificers, forged from the silver ore of the mountains where the drakes dwelled. The elorii no longer capture or ride drakes, nor have they allied with wyrms since their rebellion. Like most of their history as slaves, the elorii are not proud of the actions of the Wyrm Riders. The silverbows themselves, however, were too valuable to abandon, and their sculpted dragons remain as a reminder of the ancient past.
 
Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit with an attack with this weapon, it deals an additional ld6 cold damage. Any creature you attack with this bow with vulnerability to cold damage must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or gain the paralyzed condition until the end of their next turn.

Description: This longbow is constructed from hollow tubing and has a strange aquamarine hue, with accents molded into it that are reminiscent of avian wings. Each time a thunderbow is fired, its hollow construction creates a deep resonant booming that sounds like distant thunder.
History: In the aftermath of the rebellion of Eppion, the Coryani took a renewed interest in the League of Princes, and a brief period ensued where imitation Kio styles were all the rage in the city of Savona. Enthralled by this style, Xaviera val’Sheem, who despite her family was an adherent of Hurrian, crafted the beautiful thunderbow as a signature weapon for her swashbuckling adventures.
The adventuring life hardened her, and within a decade she was no longer so concerned with frivolous beauty and elegance. She eventually sold the bow to an artificer from Ulfila.
Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic bow. As a bonus action, you may charge a nocked arrow with the power of the storm and fire it at a target within range. If the attack hits, it deals an additional 2d6 thunder damage and if the target is a creature it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be pushed 10 feet and knocked prone.

ra€LGG
Weapons
Athame of High Magic
Weapon (dagger), very rare (requires attunement)
Description: This curving dagger is etched with sigils of power and draws energy that can empower spells.
History: In the Far West, the Mad Magi of Lakhrion are a scourge upon the people of that region. To defend themselves, the various city-states that dot the area scavenge through ruins, crypts and barrows for these daggers to curry the favor of the Coven of the Wailing Sisters, a group of women who have suffered at the hands of the Mad Magi. These sorceresses, while able to wield arcane might, are not as skillful as their sworn enemy and find that the daggers boost their abilities. Like a pack of wolves, they harry their nemeses en masse as the Sisters know that even with the daggers, they are no match for more than one or two of the Magi.
Abilities/Effects: This is a magic weapon which may be used as an arcane focus. This dagger possesses 3 charges. When casting a spell while using this weapon as an arcane focus, you may spend a bonus action and 1 charge to increase the effect of that spell as if you cast using a spell slot one level higher.

Bandoleer of Foe Daggers
Weapon (daggers), uncommon (requires attunement)
Description: These broad belts of Canceri design, are meant to be worn over the shoulder and across the breast. Crafted from finely tooled leather that is inlayed and decorated to make them appear as if the wearer is being consumed by a demon; with the creature’s teeth replaced by eight daggers.
History: Despite its appearance this bandoleer was not crafted by the Sarishans, but rather by the Nierites of northern Canceri. Borbala Soroka created the first belt during the First Crusade, containing a single knife deadly to fiends. Over centuries other Nierites crafted variations of the item, improving on Borbala’s original enchantments. By the time of the Cancerese insurrection there were dozens of variations being made. With the Nierites forming the backbone of the new Cancerese military, however, artificers were encouraged to work together to create new items for the brave warriors. During such a council, the best features of many bandoleer designs were combined into the modern one, with eight daggers.
Abilities/Effects: This bandoleer contains 8 magical daggers, each one imbued to do additional damage to a specific creature type. Each dagger deal an additional 1d6 piercing damage to its respective creature type.

Weapon (mace), very rare
(requires attunement by a follower ofBeltine)
Description: This is mace is made of strips of the highest- grade steel, painstakingly folded hundreds of times and wrapped to create the head of the mace. It has a long handle to counterbalance the heavy head, allowing it to be both a one-handed and two-handed weapon.
History: Deimas val’Ishi was a Beltinian Hospitaler whose skill in battle and devotion to Beltine were legendary, and matched only by her arrogance. In her hubris, she declared that she would reclaim the Twin Citadels ofBeltine and Neroth in the Blessed Lands, and reopen these holy shrines to the pilgrims. Against the wishes of her order she marched with fifty soldiers into the Blessed Lands. Only she emerged, bearing Beltine’s Kiss.
Attempts to question her were fruitless. Deimas val’Ishi 
had become quite mad. Scholars note that the mace does not appear to be ancient, however, indicating that either she had crafted it, or it had been crafted recently by someone, or something, else.
Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic mace. When you hit an undead creature with this weapon, it takes an extra 2d6 radiant damage. Should that undead have 25 hit points or fewer after taking this damage, it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be destroyed.
Clubs of Deuce
Weapon (pair of clubs), very rare (requires attunement)
Description: These twin belaying pins are elaborately carved from ironwood and with highlights lacquered in either red or blue to symbolize fire and ice.
History: Many Solani dwarves reject the path of the perfect item, and instead follow the path of penitence. Among these was Baraut, who dedicated his life to the defense of humanity. His adventures took him to Coryan, where he found the poorest plebeians lived lives of fear in the slums. Baraut became their protector, never giving his name or asking for reward. The narrow alleys of the city made his traditional warhammer unwieldy, so he crafted these clubs. Many criminals preying on the poor learned to fear the flash of fire and ice as Baraut’s clubs ricocheted off close-set walls to find their target.
Abilities/Effects: These clubs are considered to be a single weapon for attunement. While welding both clubs in combat you gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage when attacking and possess the ability to deal bludgeoning or piercing damage with these magic weapons. Unlike common clubs, the clubs of deuce possess the thrown property with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 40 feet. When you hit with a ranged attack utilizing either of these clubs it deals an additional 1d8 fire or cold damage, depending on which one of the two clubs where thrown. Immediately after the attack, the club flies back to your hand.
 
Cradok Durass “Earthshaker”
Weapon (great club), very rare (requires attunement)
Description: The heavy steel head is carved to resemble a bull, the flat of the maul crafted as the bull’s forehead. From the stomach of the bull extends a long, dark haft of ironwood, carved with runes of power. The pommel is a simple steel ring from which a lanyard hangs.
History: On a rainy evening, a huge figure lumbered out of the night and approached a Shining Patrol station in the no man’s land between the Ssethregoran Empire and the Altherian Republic. As the figure entered the dim illumination from the firelight, it was revealed to be an Ibon, an eight-foot-tall, yellow crested humanoid, dressed and girded for war. The Altherian soldiers, dumbfounded, reached for their weapons in preparation for a fight. The Ibon, looking unconcerned sat down at the fire, and began to prepare a meal. Perplexed, the men questioned the hungry giant as to its intentions. In perfect Low Coryani, responded, “You need all the help you can get against these snakes and I’m very good at killing things... for a price.”
This was the beginning of one of the oddest arrangements in the history of the Shining Patrol. It seems that the Ibon, named Radjuborn, used to be an indentured slave/body guard for a Ymandrake 'merchant”. His master was killed while traveling through the southern provinces of the Coryani Empire and Radjuborn decided to seek employment elsewhere. He had heard of the Shining Patrol and how they accepted anyone regardless of nationality, race or background and decided to join where he could be guaranteed constant food and shelter. It took some time and many solo forays by Radjuborn across the border to prove himself, but eventually he was accepted into the Patrol.
Radjuborn swung Cradok Durass with bone shattering force, and the last sight of many Ssethregorans was the great club shattering their shield before smashing into them. Many of his fellow patrolmen asked about the incredible weapon, but all he would say was that it was given to him by his previous employer, a sorcerer of some lepule.
After two decades of battling the ssethrics, he rose to be an officer, before finally being dragged down during an ambush. It took over a dozen Agamassi ss’ressen to finally overwhelm 
him, but it was there that Radjuborn’s legend was writ, as he made a last stand to allow those under his command to escape. He was last seen beneath a veritable hill of the large lizard men, his famed shield, Cradok Morket torn from his grasp, while still swinging his great club.
Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magical great club. When you roll a 20 on an attack roll with this weapon, the target takes an extra 2d8 bludgeoning damage. In addition, when targeting a creature with a shield you may make an attack roll with disadvantage to strike the shield instead of the creature. If the attack hits, the creature takes no damage but their shield is destroyed. If the creature is using a magical shield, the creature must drop it but it remains intact.
Dagger of
One Thousand Cuts
Weapon (dagger), very rare (requires attunement)
Description: This finely crafted dagger appears for all appearances like a simple dagger. However, whenever it is thrown, or swung about, a swarm of partially real daggers seems to flow after it.
History: This finely crafted dagger was as a gift by the mage Telven, to a rogue lost an arm while protecting him. This rogue was a master at wielding twin daggers in combat, but the loss of his left arm left him at quite the disadvantage. Feeling somewhat responsible for his friend’s predicament, Telven fashioned a new, and quite special dagger for his friend.
Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. If you use this weapon to make a ranged attack and your attack hits, add ld4+l dice to your damage roll.

Demonsbane
Weapon (dagger), very rare (requires attunement)
Description: This is a curved dagger, its steel stained sickly red by infernal blood. The edge appears ragged and corroded, yet it neither crumbles away nor grows dull. The hilt is wrapped with thin strips of white cloth, each printed with fine invocations and sigils of protection against Infernals.
History: While this dagger is normally found among Sarishans and those who hunt Infernals, it was first created by the blasphemous Seekers of the Hidden Master. Though these heretics consort with demons, they are not stupid, and crafted the first such daggers in case their Infernal patrons preferred slaughter to bargains. The dagger must be crafted precisely, according to arcane geometry and wrapped in sigils of protection. The Seekers use blasphemous infernal litanies for this, though others tend to use cants of binding from the temple of Sarish. Finally, the dagger must be tempered in the blood of an unbound infernal. This last requirement accounts for the rarity of the dagger, even after the unsealing of the north.
Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. This bonus increases to +3 when you use this dagger to attack an infernal. Furthermore, while holding this weapon you gain advantage on saving throws made against spells cast by infernals or those with tainted blood, such as a dark-kin.
Doomherald
Weapon (hand axe), very rare (requires attunement)
Description: This magnificent hand axe represents
the pinnacle of forging technology known to the
dwarves of Tultipet. Like many superior magical
weapons of dwarven manufacture, the blade is
made from ingots of green-iron and black-iron
steel, superheated then compressed, folded and
magically cooled hundreds of times, ensuring a
durable and razor sharp edge. The center of its
blade is carved out, leaving a hollow space behind
the edge, with a haft of ribbed ironwood and a
chain to secure the weapon against a possible slip.
History: Duleng Firand of Tultipet crafted this axe under the inspiration of an oracular dream. He did not know why he was so compelled, but he felt a great dread from the vision, naming the axe Doomherald. Both he and his apprentices used the axe as a template for other creations, but the original always stayed in his forge, waiting for its time. That time finally came when the great dragon, Villa’tavorentes, exacted his revenge and destroyed the enclave of Tultipet. Finally, Duleng knew the purpose of his vision. He has abandoned the forge to wander the land, 
his axe does heralding the doom of not the True Dragon that devastated his home and people, but the humans and their descendants that released it.
Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage when attacking with this magic weapon. While this weapon is held, you
may use an action to see through up to 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt for up to 10 minutes.
This axe has the thrown property with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. When you hit with a ranged attack using this weapon it deals an extra ld8 thunder damage or, if the target is a giant, 2d8 thunder damage. When used to make a ranged attack, this axe immediately returns to your hand once the attack is finished.
Fangs of Vapriss
Weapon (javelin), rare
Description: These weapons are built from the bones of serpents and have been enchanted so as to transform into serpents when thrown in combat.
History: These javelins were created during the elorii uprising and used with great efficacy by the ruthless ssanu general, Vapriss, the Venom of Yig. This holy champion of the Ssethric deity delighted in taking elorii skulls as trophies, which she would hang on a specially crafted net that covered her long, sinuous body. She commanded the artificers of Yahssremore to create javelins that changed shape into a likeness of her blessed goddess. She particularly terrified the elorii for she dedicated every elorii killed as a tribute to the goddess Yig. To this day, none of the elorii souls killed by Vapriss has been resurrected through the Orumar.
Abilities/Effects: This javelin is a magical weapon. When you hurl it and speak the command word, it transforms into a large viper and attacks your intended target at the beginning of your turn for 8 turns, or until your intended target is dead. When either of these conditions occurs, the viper dissolves into green mist, reappearing as a javelin in your hand. Once this ability is used it cannot be called upon again until the next dawn, though the javelin continues to function as a magical weapon.
For stats on the giant viper, use the snake (poisonous, giant) stats from the Core rules.
 
Forger of Chains
Weapon (dagger), rare (requires attunement)
Description: This dagger has a cross guard shaped like the gaping mouth of a fiend, with the blade sticking out of its mouth as if it were its tongue. This cross guard is connected to a bracelet worn by the wearer, while the blade is inscribed with Sarishan sigils.
History: During the Time of Terror, when the infernal hordes marched south, there was a great need to study unbound infernals to develop tactics against them. Ceren val‘Mehan saw an opportunity to gain a profit while also increasing humanity’s knowledge of these fiends. She crafted the first of these weapons, and became renowned as an infernal bounty hunter. For a princely sum, she and her mercenary band would hunt down an unbound infernal of the type desired, paralyze it with forger of chains, and drag it back to civilization to be studied, enslaved, or dissected as their patrons wished. It was not long before the infernals learned of this and began hunting her down, at which point she decided she had earned enough wealth and retired, leaving the weapon to her protégé.

While you may only bind one creature at a time, as a reaction you may choose to shed your own blood with the weapon, utilizing your blood to empower the binding.
For every 10 hit points of damage you sacrifice, you increase the duration of the creature’s entrapment 1 day. This damage may not be healed while the creature is bound by this weapon.

Kur’s Tooth
Weapon (spear), very rare (optional attunement)
Description: This magical spear appears to be crudely made, its point made of unnaturally hard, carved and scrimshawed horn.
History: About the ancient Yahssremoran city of Tasmek ranged the nomadic Gar known as the Gar Kur. These Gar were constantly harried by undead created by the ssethric necromancer-priests of Wantir, the God of the Death. Within Tasmek, these reptilian necromancers created undead servants, some of which rose again as intelligent undead, unsuitable to their needs and cast them out into the wilderness.
With so many Gar falling prey to these undead, the shamans of the tribe gathered to create a weapon to protect their people. In a dark ritual, they invoked the spirits and consecrated the spear by using it to sacrifice their chieftain. The blood- soaked spear was given to the chieftain’s eldest, to hunt down and destroy the undead. But a weapon created by black magic cannot be used for long without tainting the wielder. The spear awakened and whispered its secrets to the tribe’s new leader. It tempted him with more power, enough to challenge the might of priests of Wantir.
Eventually, the Gar chieftain led a raid with many of his own raised from the dead and began slaughtering the ssethrics of Tasmek. The High Priest of Wantir, Prasshk, was forced to call for assistance to fend off the attack and as well as take back control of the city, as the dead now outnumbered the living. In the end the empire had to raze the entire city to the ground. The Gar Kur were exterminated, though the spear was never found.
 
Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
Optional Attunement: If you choose to become attuned to this spear and are not attuned to any other weapons, Kur’s Tooth begins to whisper to you, revealing its greater power.
Eventually, as an action the spear grants you the ability to call forth a wave of necrotic energy that you may focus on one of two effects:
You may force all undead with a CR of 2 or lower within 60 feet to make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the undead is utterly destroyed. Undead who succeed on this save or have a CR greater than 2 are unaffected.
You may use this energy to cast animate dead, creating three skeletons who follow your commands until the next dawn.
Once either of these abilities is used, neither may be used again until the next midnight.
Legionspear
Weapon (spear), rare
Description: The legionspear, called a pilum by the legionnaires, is a primarily a throwing spear, though it can be used in melee, if necessary.
History: When Aneas val’Assante was made general of the Legion of the Triumphant Rays of the Invincible Sun, the legion had been nearly destroyed in the recent Coryani-Ymandrake war. Aneas reorganized the legion from the ground up, developing new tactics focusing on the pilum. Playing on the legion’s name, he trained his men to throw the pilum in tandem, like the triumphant rays of the sun flashing out at the darkness. The Emperor was impressed that Aneas had salvaged a legion so near destruction, and granted him resources that the general used to make the first legionspears for his best commanders.
Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus to ranged attack and damage rolls made with this magical weapon.

Description: Smoothed by centuries of use, this stout, undecorated, oaken staff is a blessed weapon of the Flealer aspect of Beltine.
History: The origins of the necrotic plague that swept the southern reaches of the Imperium of Man 
are unknown. Some blamed Ssethregoran bio-engineering, or an infernal curse, while others saw judgment of the Gods. Those it did not kill swiftly suffered a far worse fate, a wasting illness that ended with transformation into a hideous undead horror. Thais val’Ishi, priestess of Beltine, insisted on traveling to the afflicted land to study the plague. There she dwelled, healing whom she could. Those that she could not heal she slew, for the destruction of the undead was a mercy. It was during these years that she crafted this staff, to aid her both in healing, and in destruction. Thais and her followers were able to stem the tide of the disease, but not before it claimed her life. Her apprentice took up the staff, and showed Thais its final mercy by destroying the creature she became.

Nerothian Assassins Blade
Weapon (dagger), uncommon
Description: Pitted and badly rusted, this unassuming blade is nonetheless a dangerous and powerful tool.
History: After their initial defeats in the Heretic Wars many Milandisians began to talk of surrender. At that moment, however, death struck Ashvan. Children, innocent townsfolk, and even priests of the church were slain by a contagion which healers soon declared to be magical and deliberately inflicted. Passions against the Nerothian disease-bearers raged, and the people of Milandir rallied to battle once again. But it was not Nerothians who had committed the deed. A Priest of Hurrian, seeking to motivate the people, had crafted this dagger to cast blame on the Cancerese.
When this was discovered investigators were horrified. The priest was given a swift traitor’s death, and the entire incident was silenced by order of King Andreas II. The dagger itself was stolen by thieves, and the copies eventually created can be purchased on the black market.
 
Abilities/Effects: If you score a critical hit against a creature or deal sneak attack damage to a creature, you may cast contagion (save DC 14, disease option slimy doom) targeting that creature. Once this ability is used it may not be used again until midnight.

With her allies, she took the long trek through Canceri and in Nishanpur she endeared herself to the Illiirites known as the Confraternity of the Just Death, who further enchanted the mace.

History: At the battle of Hope’s End, the Infernal Horde finally turned and faced the assembled forces of the armies of the First Emperor of Coryan. There, a legendary duel was fought between the forces of the Devil King Uhxbractit and the First Emperor. According to legend, the battle raged for eight days until the First Emperor was struck with a poisoned dart. The base attack was witnessed by young Yolim val’Tensen and vowed that the cowardly attack would not go unanswered. As the mass of humanity rushed down on their Infernal foes in vengeance, Yolim took up his shortspear, called upon the strength of the god Hurrian and let fly.
It is said that Hurrian and Sarish looked down upon the young warrior and the treachery that befell Illiir’s chosen and sent Their blessings, with Hurrian strengthening his arm and Sarish blessing the dart. The spear flew over the charging legionnaires and struck true, burying itself in the breast of the foul, fiend that had poisoned the Emperor. There was a blinding flash of light and a howl of pure terror from the creature. As the light cleared, the Infernal was no more; vengeance had been served.

He raided his family treasury, discovering vials of infernal ichor handed down from an adventuring ancestor. Using the blood, he crafted shadowsong, and with it he won many duels.

Description:
This sickle is comprised of a silver blade ornamented with oak leaves and acorns with a shaft made from the finest oak.
History: The
legends of the Legion of the Mighty Oak are too numerous to count, but outsiders rarely hear of the cadre of Saluwean druids who forego their sacred groves to join the legion as a support unit. Dressed in hide and leather instead of lorica, and performing sacred rituals to heal the wounded and cleanse the land after every battle, the powers of these druids have contributed greatly to the success 
of the legion. In the fourth century Lebuin val’Dellenov, archdruid of the Golden Boughs of Saluwe, acknowledged their sacrifice by commissioning new weapons for the druids who were averse to the traditional gladii.

The handle of this blade is wrapped in blood-stained leather; blood drawn by the thorns that pierce the leather and the hand of the wielder.
History: Agrippas val’Inares is said to have created this blade during the Shadowed Age. He did not. As he grew older Agrippas felt the calling to enter a portal for an unknown destination, like all val’Inares. He was met on the other side by Ssanu of the Ssethregoran Empire, eager to sacrifice him. One of them wielded Torment, and Agrippas ripped the dagger from the creature’s grip. Immediately he felt a kinship with the blade, and could wield it expertly and escape. The experience addled his mind deeply, and little of what he was able to express to the val’Inares family made sense, but his rantings were written down in scrolls kept secret by the family, and Torment itself became a holy relic of Anshar. Agrippas re-entered a portal three years later, and never returned.

Wind Staff
Weapon (quarterstaff), very rare (requires attunement)
Description: A quarterstaff made from the wood of a white ash tree, decorated with carvings depicting swirling air and a pair of horns on top.
History: During the First Crusade of Light, the leader who forged the Coryani Empire found himself pinned with the Corlathian Mountains at his back and besieged on all sides by hordes of infernals. Undaunted, the First Emperor climbed to the summit of Mt. Olmacha, found a white ash tree that grew there, and broke off a branch. Within moments, he had fashioned a staff whose top was curved like ram’s horns.
As he crafted the staff, he was observed by a val’Tensen shepherd who hid behind an outcropping of rocks and stared in wonder at the Emperor’s calm demeanor, knowing that an army of infernals stood ready to smash his fledgling legions at nightfall. The shepherd’s reverie was broken by his commanding voice, calling him from his hiding place. “Come to my side, Lenes val’Tensen, and see what I have wrought. ” Shaken, the young shepherd approached.
The First Emperor held the staff aloft and suddenly the faint winds began to swirl and gather strength, until they roared like a wounded beast.
A small whirlwind appeared, unfolding like a fresh bloom. Nestled within, a great air elemental lord appeared and bowed its head. “What is thy bidding, co us in ? ’’With but a few words, the Emperor made clear his desires. That evening, the infernals were routed by not just the forces of the Coryani legions, but by the might of the Lord of the Howling Winds and his hosts. After the battle, the Emperor called for the val’Tensen shepherd and gave him the staff. Fie spoke of the deadly evil that roamed the lands on the other side of the mountain range and his desire that his people be guarded against these perils. The Emperor tasked the young man with forming a cadre of rangers to patrol the mountains, and whispered in his ear the secret of crafting such a staff so that they could be armed with the power of the winds.
Years passed and the infernal hordes became trapped behind the Wall of the Gods. The First Emperor passed on and the fledging alliance of territories grew into the vast Coryani Empire. True to his vow, Lenes val’Tensen gathered men about him and taught them to survive and thrive in the rugged mountainous terrain. When the training of his first group was complete, he called upon the power of the staff to contact the Lord of the Howling Winds and was surprised to see that a lone small elemental of air appeared instead. “You are not the Lord of the Howling Winds,”Lenes gaped in surprise. “You are not the Emperor,” the elemental replied matter-of-factly.
The wind staff is the symbol of the val’Tensen rangers who protect those who travel throughout the Corlathian mountain range. The secret of its creation has been handed down exactly as the First Emperor instructed. An apprentice ranger must craft his own staff, empower it, and attune an air elemental to heed its call.
Abilities/Effects: You gain a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While you are attuned to this item, you gain a fly speed of 30 feet.
Summon Air Elemental: As an action you may summon an air elemental of a CR equal to double your proficiency bonus. The elemental appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 120 feet of you. It remains for a maximum of 1 hour, until you use another action to dismiss it, or until it drops to 0 hit points, after which it returns to its elemental plane. While summoned, the elemental is friendly to you and to your companions. It obeys any commands you give it, no matter what language you use. If you fall unconscious or fail to command it, the elemental defends itself and you against attackers but takes no other actions. After the elemental departs, this property cannot be used again until 7 days have passed.

History: Young Bianca Desiderio, unlike many of her peers on the streets of Old Coryan, was determined to make something of herself. She spent what coins she could beg or pickpocket on lessons, studied magical crafting, and eventually became apprenticed to an artificer, but she never 
forgot where she came from. When Big Dario was killed in a turf war, she made the first seeking sling so her old gang could avenge him.

Weapon (short bow, unique), legendary (requires attunement by a val’Borda)
Description: Silent Death is an ancient composite short bow crafted from the finest polished ebony wood.
History: Idesta val’Borda was only fifteen when she fought at the Battle of Hope’s End. When the Second Crusade began, she was an old woman, but her intelligence had not diminished. She saw that Abessios itself was impenetrable, for the Vizier of the Phaeron Kefrin had mastery of the magical spells warding that city. She could no longer enter battle herself, but she strained her powers to the breaking point crafting her finest weapon, Silent Death. When the bow was completed she died, her spirit spent in the summoning of such power. Taking up the bow the
 
val’Borda marched on Abessios. As the Vizier opened his mouth to command his arcane powers the bow was fired, and silence fell upon him. Before he could recover, Twilight Warriors had jumped through shadow and buried their blades in him. The way to Abessios was opened.

WOnDRQUS Items 

 

Amulet of Belisarda’s Fury
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by an elorii)
Description: These amulets appear as simple wooden holy symbols bearing the symbol of Belisarda.
History: After the Godswar, the priesthood of Belisarda knew that while their vengeance might be postponed, the elorii homelands must remain defended. These amulets were first forged in Elonbe for that purpose and enhanced the reputation of the Vastwood as being impenetrable to humans. After the Malfelan elorii began using these amulets on their assaults on mankind, the Life Wardens altered these items, requiring an oath, dedicated to Belisarda, to defend the elorii homelands in order to activate the amulet. While this might seem a simple thing, it has nonetheless been effective at dissuading the abuse of these items by elorii who might ignore Ardelia’s prophecy.
Abilities/Effects: This amulet has 3 charges and regains ld3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a roll of 1 the amulet cannot regain charges until submerged in an Orumar for 1 day.

For 1 minute, all your melee weapon attacks and unarmed strikes deal an additional ld4 damage of their usual type and you gain advantage on all Strength checks.

Amulet of Illiir’s Perfect Brilliance
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a divine spellcaster ofllliir)
Description: This amulet that is fashioned from hand-carved alder branches and shaped into a sunburst after weeks of pain-staking work.
It is then blessed and consecrated to Illiir.
History: When humans arrived on the shores of Onara they faced a dilemma. The amidet of
 
Illiir’s perfect brilliance, worn by the most faithful of the King of the Gods, must be crafted from freshly cut, hale branches of the alder tree. Seeds of the alder tree had been brought to the continent, but the trees that grew from them were subtly changed by the new soil and climate, and were no longer perfect in Illiir’s sight. For a full one thousand years, holy orders of Saluwe tended to sacred groves across the Imperium in the grandest husbandry project known to human history. Finally, with much rejoicing and great celebration, the Priesthood ofllliir pronounced one of their alder trees to be sufficiently perfect to once again craft the amulet. This “perfect” strain of trees has been carefully guarded and cultivated ever since, and only a few branches are allowed to be cut each year by properly consecrated artificers.
Abilities/Effects: This amulet may be used as a divine focus. While this amulet is worn, it will emit a faint light equivalent to a candle, shedding bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. You can activate or suppress this ability at will.
This amulet has 3 charges and regains ld3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a roll of 1 the amulet cannot regain charges until you place it in the light of the sun for a total of 24 hours.
While wearing this amulet, you may use an action and expend a charge to cast daylight.
Amulet of the Faithful
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by worshiper of the deity of the amulet)
Description: These amulets are simple platinum discs etched with a deity’s holy symbol on the front and a prayer to the deity on the obverse.
History: The first records of these amulets stretch back to the early days of the Imperium of Man. According to records, the priesthood and those mages among the faithful worked together to mass produce these amulets as tokens for the clerisy. Alas, since the fall of the Imperium such production is impossible, and these amulets have become both rarer and more valuable. Some examples have been found among the elorii, which are officially explained as the elorii corrupting human symbols of devotion. Fiowever, a few obscure 
reports from the Emerald Society claim to have found similar items written in Ssethric, stretching back to the Empire of Yahssremore, suggesting that perhaps it was the humans who learned the art of these amulets from the elorii instead. These reports are controversial and are dismissed by most scholars.
Abilities/Effects: These amulets are inscribed with the holy symbol of a single specific deity. If you worship the god whose symbol is on the amulet, you may use the amulet as a divine focus. Also, any time you use the Channel Divinity feature you gain 1d10 temporary hit points for 1 hour.
Amulet of Vigilance
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
Description: Crafted from jade and carved to appear as a holy symbol of Kassegore (a serpent devouring its own tail), this armlet will increase or decrease in size to fit any wearer's bicep.
History: At the height of the Ssethregoran Empire these armlets were crafted by the Priesthood of Kassegore to protect their troops from the many enslaved and oppressed beings who sought to revolt against their reptilian masters. These items have become increasingly rare in modern times, mainly because elorii will destroy them wherever they find them, and wearing the symbol of Kassegore in the Ssethregoran Empire is considered blasphemy since the coming of the Varn. All attempts to alter the appearance of these armlets by the Ssethregorans have failed, which some see as a sign that the items are inherently blasphemous.
Abilities/Effects: While wearing this amulet you have a +5 bonus to your passive Perception and advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks. If you are surprised while wearing this amulet, you can call upon its power to act normally during your first turn. Once used, this ability cannot be used again until the next dawn.

Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
Description: This beautiful, finely wrought, golden chain is studded with blood-red rubies and sparkling diamonds. Designed to be worn about the ankle, it is often seen in the possession of wealthy women across the Known Lands.
History: This item was created by a besotted mage for his Larissan priestess and the sisters of her “temple”. What followed was a series of robberies
 
and bloody murders in every major city of the Coryani Empire and into the Kingdom of Milandir. The crime spree ended abruptly in the city of Tralia, when the entire coterie was found strangled in a local brothel. Though the assassins were never identified, many believe it was the Troupe of the Final Note, posing as the entertainment in the brothel.
Abilities/Effects: While this anklet is worn you are immune to the poisoned condition. Additionally, as an action you may cast sleep (save DC 12). Once used, this ability cannot be used again until the next dawn.
Apron of the Artificer
Wondrous item, rare
Description: This blackened and fire-scarred leather apron contains numerous tiny pockets.
When worn by an artificer, this apron grants access to a number of different tool-kits, all readily available at hand.
History: The dwarven master-smith Tergaunt of Solanos Mor is remembered both for his skill and as a cautionary tale. Like many of his brethren, he was dedicated to crafting the perfect item in order to free his enclave, yet he found the inefficiency of the crafting process intolerable. He turned his prodigious skill toward time-saving devices. One of his greatest successes was the creation of the apron of the artificer, thus saving precious minutes by avoiding having to search for the right tool in a cluttered smithy. Ironically, Tergaunt’s obsession with creating time-saving magic items consumed him, and he died without ever attempting to craft the perfect item.
Abilities/Effects: While this apron is worn you may take an action to reach into any of the apron’s many pockets and produce a tiny set of mundane tools, which grow to full size once placed upon the ground. You may only produce one set of tools at a time, any previously drawn tools vanish into mist. Tools drawn from the apron of the artificer remain in existence until the next dawn.
Armbands of Blade Turning
Wondrous item, rare
Description: Worn high on the arms, these bracers temporarily protect their wearer from blows. Made from board hide, they are lined with linen or silk and are edged with iron bands, sewn on with catgut.
History: These armbands are a recent creation, dating from the withdrawal of the Coryani empire from the Hinterlands. The Yhing hir realized they needed better tools to expand 
and thrive in a region suddenly empty of the legions, and their Nawals overcame their suspicion and rivalry to command their greatest crafters to work together to create such tools. Several magical items were created, but one of the most renowned and most sought-after by the horsemen of the Yhing hir were armbands of blade turning, which best suited the lightly-armored and highly-mobile horsemen.
Abilities/Effects: These armbands possess 3 charges. While worn, as a reaction to being struck by a melee attack, you can expend 1 charge to gain resistance to slashing damage, including damage from the triggering attack, until the end of your next turn. These armbands recover 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.
Armguard of Talisos
Wondrous item, very rare

The armguards of Talisos are among his most treasured creations. For years he toiled, crafting precisely one thousand of the armguards, of which an unknown number have survived to the present day. While rare and jealously guarded, the armguards are not considered sacred and so have, rarely, been given to outsiders that perform acts of great courage and self¬sacrifice to help the elorii nations.
Abilities/Effects: While wearing this armguard you ignore half and three-quarters cover when attacking with a longbow or shortbow.
Winds of Osalian: You
must be an elorii to attune to this item. As a bonus action, you can gain advantage on a ranged attack with a bow. Once used, this ability cannot be used again until you have completed a short rest.

They are sewn or pinned onto backpacks, pouches, hats or other equipment. Warders are fashioned from any material used to fashion dolls, but jade or a precious metal is sometimes used.
History: These decorative objects were originally created by the paranoid and eccentric Moratavian wizard Badua the Strange, who made them to foil assassinations, ward belongings from thieves, and guard her while she slept. They remain constantly active, scaring off would- be assailants and ruining surprise attacks by emitting unearthly howls and haunting sounds as a warning to their wearer

Tales of horsemen tearing through lines, leaving nothing but a bloody smear in their wake are particularly true of those mounts equipped with this enchanted armor. The tactic known as the ‘steel storm’, so called because of the thunder of the horses’ hooves and the clouds of dust raised, was originally developed by the val’Tensen using mounts wearing this armor strategically placed throughout the line. It proved so effective that other armies using cavalry have their own variation of this tactic.

Abilities/Effects: This suit of breastplate barding grants your mount advantage on Constitution saving throws.

Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a worshiper of Beltine)
Description: These pins are forged in the shape of a censer, the holy symbol of the Goddess Beltine.
History: During the Imperium of Man a great theological debate raged between Beltinians and Nerothians over the virtues of Neroth’s gift. The Beltinians believed the gift should only be tolerated when spontaneously granted by Neroth, if at all. The Nerothians, on the other hand, believed the gift should be deliberately spread to the worthy. While the debate raged the Beltinian priesthood took matters into their own hands, crafting these pins to protect themselves from rogue Nerothian necromancers, whom they warned preyed upon the newly deceased faithful and destroyed their soul. A panic began, and those wealthy enough gladly donated to the Beltinian temple to receive a pin and protect themselves from the Nerothians. On a wave of public paranoia, the Beltinians won the debate, and the temple continues to create the pins to this day.

Blood Robe
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
Description: This robe is trimmed with black thread, decorated with rooster feathers and tied with a belt of sharkskin.
History: In the early days of the Coryani Empire, the priesthood of Anshar became aware of a fanatical sect of Ansharan monks who had crossed the line into heresy.
While Ansharans of all kind endure pain as a holy devotion, this sect devoted themselves to an aspect of Anshar wholly devoted to experiencing and causing all forms of pain, purely for its own sake. Seeking to deal with this threat internally before the Inquisition became involved, the Ansharans dispatched their holy champions, the Bearers of Woe.
What the Bearers of Woe found in the sect’s monastery has never been revealed, but the sect ceased to exist, and the Bearers of Woe emerged with the first blood robes. Since that time, they have learned to craft more of these items, though they remain rare outside the ranks of Ansharan champions.

History: Poor Alwan was a good boy; bright, respectful of his elders, and brave. Unfortunately, he had no talent when it came to riding a horse and in the Yhing hir culture, that is tantamount to being less than nothing.
The Yhing hir prize their mounts above all things and believe firmly that a man without a horse is no man. Fearing that his inability to ride competently would doom him to a life of servitude, his mother begged an Ehtzara to help her boy. The night before his right of passage, the mystic gave his mother a magical bridle and by mid¬afternoon, Alwan was inducted into the tribe as an adult. Sadly, his mother could not celebrate with the young man, as the Ehtzara came to collect his due, claiming her as his new apprentice, just as they’d bargained.
Abilities/Effects: While you are controlling a mount wearing this bridle, your mount can take the Help action in addition to its normal options. Your mount can assist you or another friendly creature provided the task your mount is helping with is something it can reasonably do. Most mounts cannot pick locks or bluff a guard. If your mount is independent and wearing this bridle, you can use your bonus action to Help your mount instead.

Boots of Balance
Wondrous item, uncommon
Description: These boots are made from glossy-black whale skin and are prized by duelists.
History: The dueling schools of Savona have long been famed for their acrobatic and theatrical fighting styles, and thus an enterprising young crafter by the name of Ciro val’Sheem felt it would be the perfect place to market his boots of balance. He found that the most respected duelists disparaged him; no one would rely on such a crutch rather than skill alone. Still, his boots were very popular among those who cared more about results than etiquette, and Ciro val’Sheem died a wealthy man, even if he never had the respect he desired.
Abilities/Effects: While you wear these boots you gain advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks.
Graceful Steps (Requires Attunement): While wearing these boots, as an action you can click your heels to together to cast enhance ability (cat’s grace effect only, no concentration required) on yourself. Once used, this ability cannot be used again until the next dawn.
Boots of Knocking
Wondrous item, rare
Description: These mid-calf high boots are crafted from fine leathers and polished to a mirror shine.
History: The first of these boots were made famous during the early years of the Coryani Empire, when the famed warrior, Deveros val’Assante, single-handedly quelled a revolt at the ancient walled city of Sulpecci. Reports vary in some details, but all agree that Deveros is said to have kicked in the sealed, barred and bolted gates to the city before cowing the leaders of the insurgency. When Deveros perished in a Voei ambush, his boots were lost with him. Since then, the boots have surfaced occasionally, before finally falling into the hands of Vespoltoc, a Tultipetan craftsman.
Vespoltoc managed to determine that these boots were created in the lost dwarven enclave of Corett Palas, famed for creating exquisite and unique magical garments. Overjoyed at having discovered this, he dedicated the next few decades of his life to duplicating this rare and powerful item. Finally succeeding he made his copies available to those outside of Tultipet.

Humans first gained these items during the Godswar, when they took them from the corpses of their elorii foes

Wondrous item, legendary
Description: This unadorned heavy metal box is two-feet wide, five-feet long and two-feet deep, sometimes marked with the glyph of the mage who created it.
History: During the Imperium of Man, the secrets of these boxes were tightly held by the Pantheonistic Church, which used them to disenchant items that they considered cursed, heretical, or just too dangerous to be allowed to exist. With the fall of the First Imperium, however, these boxes and the secrets of their manufacture spread to become the bane of mages everywhere. While these items are not illegal to own, their use is widely despised by magical craftsmen across Onara. The Sorcerer King sees the very existence of these boxes as an affront to his magical power. He has instructed his minions to harvest anyone they discover with such a box, regardless of their magical ability.
Abilities/Effects: Any non-artifact magical item placed within this box is rendered non-magical after one hour. Sentient items placed within the box receive no save to resist this effect. The box can be used this way up to 3 times.

If the artifact is made non-magical, the creature that placed it in the box must succeed on a DC 25 Wisdom saving throw or suffer 10d10 force damage and permanently lose the spellcasting feature, which they can never regain.

He recently returned from a trading expedition to that island bearing a chest full of wondrous gifts. Amongst them were a dozen pair of bracers with a unique property. The Naori chieftain claimed that their god, a being that lives in the active volcano in the center of the island, empowered the bracers to protect the natives from the raiders that came from the “black ships made of stone”. While the Naori consider the bracers to be a gift from their god, these mysterious raiders had not landed on their shores since before the chieftain’s grandfather’s time. The pirate captain’s offer of a dozen blonde-haired sacrifices for their volcanic deity was seen as a fair trade by the Naori.

Bracers of the Thunderer
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
Description: These are a set of golden bracers inscribed with the glyphs of the Storm Lord, Hurrian.
History: During the Shadow Age, the lands that now comprise the war-torn lands of Almeric were crushed beneath the tyrannical heel of the Auxunite warlords. Resistance towards these oppressive tyrants created strange bedfellows. On such instance was the dear friendship struck between the Solani dwarf Entalwen and a monk by the name of Aidic val’Tensen. Aidic belonged to a pacifistic order that refused to involve themselves in the rebellion, but the young monk could not stand idly by while his fellow man suffered.
Entalwen crafted a magnificent set of golden bracers inscribed with the glyphs and symbols of the Storm Lord, Hurrian to aid him in his battles. Unfortunately, the bracers of the thunderer were not enough to save Aidic from the wrath of the mighty Warlord Khidath, who left the monk’s broken body draped over the central gates of Nevanne as a warning to those contemplating further insurrection. In the dead of night, Entalwen snuck into the city and retrieved his friend’s shattered corpse.
Recovering the bracers,
BRACERS OF THE
THUNDERER 
he worked feverishly to recreate them and months later delivered twenty sets to Aidic’s brethren in the Monastery of the Iron Wind.
Eventually, a coalition of dwarves from Solanos Mor, the val’Tensen family and the human populace of the region overthrew the occupying forces of the Auxunite Empire. Aidic’s death galvanized the monks of the Iron Wind to action; they lead the rebellion against their oppressors at the cost of their lives. With their death, the Monastery of the Iron Wind faded from memory and with them vanished the bracers of the thunderer. Emerald Society scholars believe that the bracers are hidden away in some as yet undiscovered Auxunite treasure trove or within the lost monastery of the Iron Wind.
Abilities/Effects: While these bracers are worn you have resistance to thunder and lightning damage. If you are hit by a spell or effect that deals thunder or lightning damage, you may use your reaction to envelop the bracers in a sheathe of lightning and booming energy for 1 minute.

The two priesthoods created the censer of the raven to assist in the battle against the undead, and prove the good will of the Nerothians.

Description: Standing six feet tall, this tall Altherian clock is elaborately carved. Its dial, rimmed with glyphs, has four hour hands and four minute hands. The body of the clock is carved with images of alien environments and unusual otherworldly creatures.
History: This clock was created during the Time of Terror to protect against the invading infernal horde. It has since been moved to the Cathedral of Knowledge, the largest temple of Althares, located in the city of Althre’.

Cloud Cape
Wondrous item, very rare
Description: This full-length, hooded cloak of light blue linen is woven with intricate patterns of silver thread. Under direct light these patterns appear to be flowing clouds.
History: When Filharra val’Sungha joined the Sky Knights her family, one of the wealthiest and most politically connected in Capharra, pulled all the strings they could to push her quickly through the ranks. They also hired Maeghe Alfhanse, one of the greatest Kio artificers of that day, to craft a unique magical cape to enhance her prowess in the air. Filharra was mortified by her family’s meddling, refused any commission until she had earned it, and turned the cape over to the Sky Knights. In this way she became a legend, and the cloud cape has proliferated in the order and become a signature item of many of its officers. 
Abilities/Effects: While worn you have advantage on all Dexterity (Stealth) checks while flying. If mounted on a flying mount, your mount also has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. Additionally, you may cast feather fall and levitate at will, affecting yourself only.
Collar and Key of Submission
Wondrous item, very rare
Description: This large collar is made of dull iron, engraved with a number of symbols, and the matching key bears the same symbols.
History: This heavy iron collar is not intended for comfort or convenience. Rather, its sole purpose is to force whoever wears it to submit to the will of the slaver. Beyond the simply psychological effect of being enslaved, the wearer of this collar has their mind clouded and is rendered docile.
This collar is commonly used by Chauni slavers, who happily sell copies to anyone willing to pay their price, such as the Crimson Slavers of the Pirate Isles or the dreaded
Harvesters of Ymandragore.
Abilities/Effects: These collars and keys come in matched sets. When placed on a humanoid creature they must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or have disadvantage on all saving throws against the powers of the matching key. The collar may only be removed by its companion key or by the remove curse spell.
 
Kneel Before Me (Requires Attunement): You can
attune to the key for a collar of submission, allowing you to cast certain spells on the collar matching the key. The possessor of a collar’s key may use an action to cast command and suggestion on the wearer of the matching collar at will. Additionally, the possessor of the key may use an action to cast dominate person (save DC 18) on the wearer of the matching collar, regaining the ability to do so at the next midnight.
Collar of Kinship
Wondrous item, uncommon
Description: This finely tooled collar is made of leather, engraved with images of animal spirits.
History: During the Imperium of Man, a radical sect of the val’Dellenov family took their matriarchal ideas to the extreme, and taught that men should be treated as no more than dogs. To this end, they crafted collars that allowed their male slaves to bond more closely to their “pack”. While this sect was never large and was swiftly suppressed by the appalled val’Dellenov matriarchy, the collars themselves were recognized as useful. They are often used by those who work and live with animals,
particularly among those who dwell in the Golden Boughs of Saluwe.
Abilities/Effects: While wearing this collar you have advantage on all Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks. Also, you may use your action to cast animal friendship (save DC 14). Once used, this ability may not be used again until the next dawn. 
Collar of Protection
Wondrous item, rare
Description: This heavy leather collar is designed to fit about the neck of an animal or familiar. These are typically undecorated, although some nobles are known to have gem- encrusted versions made for their personal mounts.
History: When ordered by the Mad Emperor Quron val’Dellenov to outfit her animals so that they would be more of a challenge in the arena, her beastmasters commissioned these collars and had every animal in her menagerie equipped with one. History records that the very next gladiatorial games were the bloodiest ever seen, to the Emperor’s delight.
Abilities/Effects: While worn by a beast or familiar, this collar grants them a +1 bonus to their AC and saving throws.
Collar of Resistance
Wondrous item, rare
Description: These collars appear to be ordinary leather collars with a small gem embedded in the buckle.
History: Whether worn by the mastiffs of the Order of the Phoenix to resist the necrotic touch of many of the creatures of Canceri or by the dangerous beasts commanded by the Khitani Tigermen, these collars are highly prized by those with unique mounts or bonded animal companions.

Corsair’s Cloak
Wondrous item, uncommon
Description: This light cloak, woven from aquamarine dyed silk, is trimmed with blue satin. It is clasped with a silver and mother-of-pearl frog. The high collar is embroidered to show vessels under full sail; usually these are specific and well-known privateer vessels.
History: The corsairs of the Pirate Isles have wreaked havoc on the coastlines of Onara for centuries. This cloak was first made famous by Ilitchen, King of Magra two centuries ago. Numerous corsairs and other pirates have made use of this cloak and others like it ever since.

Cosmetics of Comeliness
Wondrous item, uncommon
Description: These fine pigments, dyes and colored powders are stored in a small compartmentalized enameled box. The hinged lid has a mirror on the underside, and the exterior of the box is decorated with images depicting a harem of dancing girls.
History: When the priesthood of Larissa first changed to embrace Her aspect of forbidden pleasure, there was much debate among the clergy. Even among those who embraced aspect, some thought it should be curtailed or tempered with her oracular aspect. Many of the younger followers of Larissa saw this as the doddering conservatism of old age, and they first created cosmetics of comeliness as a symbol of rebellion against the oracular establishment, as well as their embrace of Larissa’s debauchery without reservation. As time went on this symbolic meaning of the cosmetics faded, and now these magical items are even carried by priestesses of the oracular school, albeit not frequently.
Abilities/Effects: Each box of these cosmetics possesses 3 applications. Using an application takes 1 minute and allows you to cast disguise self (save DC 15). While under this effect, you also gain advantage on all Charisma (Deception) checks made to convince others of your disguise.
Cramor’s Catalogue of Creatures
Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)
Description: This large tome is bound with thick leather.
Its spine is plated in lead and reinforced with bronze, sculpted to appear as beasts are gnawing upon the tome.
History: The first of these bizarre tomes was developed by the Ymandrake mage Cramor the Collector who presented it as a gift to his sovereign, the Sorcerer King of Ymandragore.
Abilities/Effects: This book has 50 pages. While holding 
this tome, as an action you may open the book to a blank page and point at a single creature within 60 feet of you. That creature must succeed at a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw or be absorbed into the book, filling a number of pages equal to its CR (minimum 1). If there are not enough remaining pages, the creature is unaffected.
Once captured, a detailed illustration of the creature is displayed within the book as well as information about the creature’s powers, weaknesses and equipment. A captured creature is kept in stasis indefinitely; they do not age or suffer from hunger, nor are they otherwise affected by the passage of time. The creature remains unaware of its surroundings, or anything that is happening to the tome.
As an action, you can free a captured creature by opening the tome to the first page of their section and speaking the command phrase. The creature appears wherever you desire within 60 feet of the tome. The creature is not under your control and is free to act as it desires. The pages that contained the creature crumble to dust. Casting freedom of movement or a remove curse spell upon the pages that contain a creature will also free it.
 
gauntlet was created by the sorcerer Syketh who crafted it for the most powerful mages of the Pit. During the elorii revolt, the gauntlets were used to devastating effect, obliterating scores of their former servants. But it was not enough to overcome the overwhelming number of rebels. Dozens of these gauntlets are thought to still exist, but except for the few used by the ssanu, their whereabouts are unknown.

Wondrous item, rare
Description: This elegant crystal decanter is crafted to resemble a swan in flight with a stopper in the shape of the beak of the swan. It is stored nestled in a silver case.
History: The Temple of Larissa commissioned these items from a Tir Betoqi craftsman to help cope with the insatiable desire for intoxicants during the many Larissan holy festivals.
Abilities/Effects: When the stopper is removed a steady stream of alcohol pours forth. The decanter delivers 1 pint of high quality spirits per minute. Any type of (non¬magical) alcoholic beverage can be produced, although the decanter cannot reproduce a specific brand or batch. The decanter can produce up to 20 pints of spirits. Once the decanter has reached this maximum, it cannot produce any more alcohol until the next dawn.
 
Deck of Crazemu
Description: Most of the cards in this well-worn deck are stained with wine.
History:
During the Shadowed Age, Licinius Dovitoni led a group of bandits that terrorized the eastern coast of what is now the
province of Cafela. Though the merchants and government officials offered hefty rewards for his capture, he became a folk hero to the people of Sulpecci, as he shared his ill- gotten wealth with the impoverished and oppressed. He was particularly popular with the itinerant priestesses of Larissa in the town, his good looks and charm making him welcome in Sulpecci’s many brothels.
During one of his robberies, Licinius attacked a procession of travelers and inadvertently killed one of the passengers. The victim was the High Priestess of Larissa, traveling from Savona to the outlying towns and settlements in the region. With her last breath, she cursed Licinius, forever depriving him of the Goddess of Luck and Beauty’s favor. Instantly, the handsome young raider’s body became twisted, with boils and seeping ulcers covering him. He fled wailing, knowing that his life enjoying the pleasures of the world were now denied to him.
The years of living the life of a hermit slowly drove Licinius mad. In his lunacy, he wrote prayers in supplication to the Divine Harlot, pleading for Her forgiveness on small placards with strange figures on their reverse. His desiccated body was eventually found by a group of explorers, clutching one of the decks of cards he created. Others were found scattered across the cave and they were quickly collected and divided among the group.
Abilities/Effects: While holding this deck, you enjoy a +2 bonus to all Charisma (Persuasion) and Charisma (Deception) ability checks while interacting in a city environment. The deck of Crazemu has 3 charges and deck regains 1d3 charges daily at midnight. If the cards are ever purposely split up and moved more than 5 feet away from each other, the deck loses all magical properties until all the cards are reunited.
By spending a bonus action, you may draw a card from the deck and expend 1 charge to gain advantage on your 
next Charisma (Persuasion) or Charisma (Deception) ability check. If you roll 1 on either die, the creature you are persuading or deceiving becoming hostile and refuses to interact with you.
Demonhide Cloak
Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)
Description: This crude cloak, repulsive to most people, is created from the uncured hide of an infernal. These cloaks vary as much in appearance as the creatures they are crafted from, but the one thing that remains constant is the general aura of malaise that surrounds them.
History: The first demon hide cloak was created during the First Crusade of Light as trophies. The priesthood looked askance at wearing the skins of such abominable creatures, but it was not until over a century later, when the Inquisition found themselves with more power, that the Mother Church declared these items blasphemous and ordered them destroyed on sight. What was a symbol of opposition against infernals became a symbol of devotion, and the Seekers of the Hidden Master sought to save as many demonhide cloaks as they could from the Inquisition’s cleansing flames.
With the opening of the Sealed Lands, some infernal hunters have taken to crafting these items as trophies once again, as priests are reluctant to criticize the brave defenders at the Wall of the Gods.
Abilities/Effects: While this cloak is worn you gain a +1 bonus to your AC and resistance against acid, cold, and fire damage.
Additionally, you can use an action to cast fear (save DC 16). Once used, this ability cannot be used again until the next dawn.
Devilskin Knot
Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)
Description: A devilskin knot appears to be a fist sized knot of tightly wrapped strips of black leather. Upon closer examination, the strips of leather are rough and pebbly, and seem to constantly strain against their current 
configuration. In actuality, the knot is created by flaying strips of skin from a captive barbed devil. As the final step of creating the knot, the barbed devil is imprisoned inside the item. The knot constantly writhes and struggles to undo itself as the infernal inside it seeks release.
History: Not all the clergy of Sarish wish to drive the infernals from Arcanis. There are numerous practitioners of magic, including many of Sarish’s worshippers, who take unholy glee from binding infernals to their will. The worst of these individuals, known as the Seekers of the Hidden Master, are located in the dark bowels of Canceri, where their twisted pacts with the infernals are smiled upon and encouraged. This secret society wishes to defy the will of the gods, and bring back the Devil- Kings of old, reinstating their rule over mankind as it was during the Time of Terror.
Abilities/Effects: When this item is hurled at a creature the knot explodes into a flurry of tentacles, restraining the creature and sapping its life force. As an action, you can throw the knot at a creature within 30 feet of you. That target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or become
restrained as the knot wraps securely around it. As an action on its turn, a restrained creature may attempt to escape the knot by making a DC 15 Strength or Dexterity saving throw (affected creature’s choice). On a successful saving throw, they escape the knot. If the target succeeds on their initial saving throw or later escapes the knot, it returns to you immediately, dropping next to you if you cannot grasp it.
Once the knot is restraining a creature, as an action you can force the restrained creature to succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer 2d10 points of necrotic damage. The restrained creature suffers 1 level of exhaustion for every 20 points of damage inflicted by the knot. If the restrained creature dies while affected by the knot, the knot immediately returns to your side.
Whenever the knot deals damage to a creature, roll a d20. On a roll of 1 the barbed devil trapped within breaks free, destroying the knot. This barbed devil is an unbound infernal and is not under your control; it will attack you if
n can. 
The knot has an AC of 20 and 20 hit points. It regenerates 1 hit point every 5 minutes if it has at least 1 hit point. If the knot is ever reduced to 0 hit points, it is destroyed. Roll a d8. On a roll of 1 the barbed devil is released as above.
Diadem of Mental Clarity
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
Description: These golden diadems are always set with one or more star sapphires.
History: Karaz val’Abebi was one of the greatest Altherian artisans ever known, and a member of the very Council of Wisdom that petitioned Althares for his First Gift. While his most famous works included the magnificent floating city of Khafre, he was a tireless craftsman who created many of what he called “baubles”, which to any other artisan would be masterworks. One of these was the diadem of mental clarity. While the diadem was not as great a creation as Khafre, it was perhaps more significant. Several diadems were sold to others, and it was those wearing these diadems that saw through the network of illusions protecting Khafre during its construction and hastened its end.
Abilities/Effects: This diadem has 3 charge and regains ld3 charges daily at dawn. If you expend the diadem’s last charge, roll a d20. On a roll of 1, diadem crumbles to dust.
. While worn if you are affected by an enchantment or illusion spell, you can use your reaction and expend 1 charge to gain advantage on any saving throw to resist the trigger spell’s effects.
Dimitri’s Dimensional Doorknob
Wondrous item, legendary
Description: This plain doorknob, fashioned from brass, looks like any doorknob that you might find in any villa or manor home across the Known Lands.
History: These doorknobs were first created by Dimitri Fealgren, a gnomish devotee of Cadic. Dimitri used the doorknob for several years to both steal money and food from the rich. Eventually, he perished when he carried a stolen bag of holding through the passage he created and was scattered across the Astral Plane.
 
Abilities/Effects: As an action, you can place this doorknob on any non-magical wall. Once affixed, a standard sized door appears in the wall and can be opened as if it was a normal door. Once you walk through it, the door can be closed and the doorknob removed the other side, causing the door to disappear.
If the wall is greater than 10 feet thick, opening the door reveals a 5 foot by 10-foot alcove or closet. Once you enter the alcove, the doorknob can be removed as normal, but the space created remains and can be hidden in. The alcove holds enough air for one Medium creature to survive for 1 hour.
If an item containing an extra-dimensional space is brought through a passage created by the doorknob, a rift to the Astral Plane is created and the offending item, its contents and the contents of the passageway are scattered onto that plane. If the doorknob itself is placed into an extra-dimensional space, a rift to the Shadow Plane is created and the space, its contents, the doorknob and everything within 10 feet of the doorknob are sucked through into the Shadow Plane.
Dolphin Tabard
Wondrous item, rare
Description: These tabards are embroidered with images of dolphins and decorated with gold trim.
History: In the first centuries of the Coryani Empire many magical items were created for the Coryani legions, but General Maeda val’Ossan found that few of these items served the marine tactics of her Legion of Naeraanth. With the outbreak of the Children’s Crusade she was finally able to convince Empress Shar val’Assante that new magical items were needed for her legionnaires. To assist the Legion of Naeraanth in its sea battles against the Black Fleet, the first Dolphin Tabards were created, bearing the symbol of the legion’s dolphin standard. To this day, the Dolphin Tabard is a high honor granted only by the Dolphin Guard, the Milandisian successor to the Legion of Naeraanth.
Abilities/Effects: While this tabard is worn you can breathe underwater and have a swim speed of 60 feet. Additionally, while openly worn you gain advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks made when dealing with citizens of the Kingdom of Milandir. 
Doom Bell of Canceri
Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement to a location [building])
Description: These are large funerary bells crafted from a glittering blue-black meteoric ore. Each bell weighs over 500 lbs. and must be properly balanced and mounted on its wooden stand.
History: As the Canceri insurrection against the Coryani Empire spread south, Milandisian legions stood against them in the Blighted Mire. In what the Dark Triumvirate regards as a miracle, a Nerothian priestess named Mohana val’Mordane and her outnumbered Cancerese rebels stumbled upon a vein of meteoric ore in that swamp. Struck by a vision from Neroth, the priestess commanded her fellows to mine the ore, from which she crafted the first crude doom bell, which slew many of the Milandisians and forced the rest into retreat. To this day doom bells protect many Dark Triumvirate churches, and all are crafted from the ore found only in the Blighted Mire. It is illegal in Canceri for anyone outside the Church of the Dark Triumvirate to possess any of this precious ore.
Abilities/Effects: This bell and its stand are a Large object and in order to attune the bell to a building you must place it on the roof of the building or in a bell-tower.
Once attuned, you can use an action to ring the bell while reciting a prayer to the gods of the Dark Triumvirate. When the bell is rung, any living creature within 60 feet must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or suffer 10d8 necrotic damage. After taking this damage, if a creature has 20 hit points or less they are instantly killed. Once used, this ability cannot be used again until the next midnight.
See Location Attunement Sidebar, pg. 103.
Dust of Ephemeral Allies
Wondrous item, uncommon
Description: Contained within a bottle, this dust summons forth a spirit when poured upon the ground.
History: The Forsaken Wastes is a bleak and forbidding place, appearing at first glance to be completely devoid of life. Yet, within its scorched confines there are some 
nomads, ascetics, and wild wanderers who manage to eke out a meager and difficult life. They developed these bottles to defend themselves from the dangerous creatures that also pass through the Forsaken Wastes at times.
Abilities/Effects: Each bottle of dust of ephemeral allies contains enough dust for 3 uses. As an action, you may pour some dust on the ground to create a beast or beasts as if you had cast conjure animals. After you have used the last of the dust, the bottle loses all magical properties.
Dust of Mirages
Wondrous item, very rare
Description: A golden-cream colored glass bottle, shaped as a cat, holds this dust. When the stopper, which is the cat’s head, is removed, a handful of dust streams into the air, creating mirages to confound the user’s foes.
History: Despite its modern origins, scholars debate who created the dust of mirages.
Some claim the cat shape of the phylactery that holds the dust points to a Sarishan origin, while some suggest the Troupe of the Final Note or even the elorii. One thing they are quite certain of is that the gnomish mage Reatho Gromajj could not be the creator as he claims. Granted, he does always seem to have a ready supply of the stuff, and no one can remember the dust being available before Reatho began selling it, but most val and humans simply refuse to accept that a gnome could have created something so useful.
Abilities/Effects: Each bottle of dust of mirages contains enough dust for 5 uses. As an action, you, can scatter a use of dust into the air to cast mirage arcane. After you have used the last of the dust, the bottle loses all magical properties.
Dust of Size Alteration
Wondrous item, rare
Description: A plain leather pouch contains this dust. At first glance, this dust appears to be a dull grey, but upon closer inspection each grain of the dust randomly shifts in color between white and black.
History: Tradition attributes the creation of this useful magical dust to Cadic himself. According to legend, while Cadic was attempting to woo Larissa he feared that her distaste for him would lead to rejection regardless of his music. Thus, he hid himself and began to play his enchanting song, but when she searched for the musician he used the dust of shrinking and enlargement to become small and sneaked away. After three nights of this Larissa 
was so entranced by his music, and so longed to meet the musician, that Cadic revealed himself and his wooing of Her began in earnest.
Abilities/Effects: Each pouch of this dust contains enough for 5 uses. As an action, you can sprinkle a use on a creature to cast enlarge/reduce (save DC 13) on it. After you have used the last of the dust, the pouch loses all magical properties.
Dust of Warding
Wondrous item, very rare
Description: This slender ebony tube, carved to appear as a stretching demon, holds a single dose of this rare and powerful dust.
History: This dust is rumored to have been created by the Order of the Emerald Flame under the personal direction of the Sorcerer King during the Time of Terror. Use of this dust provided wards against the infernals that conquered the mainland, leaving Ymandragore free of the fell creatures that the Sorcerer-King’s own actions had unleashed. Regardless of the truth to that rumor, this dust is most commonly found in the employ of Ymandrakes.
Recently, members of the Sanctorum of the Arcane managed to steal the secrets of dust of warding from Ymandrakes operating on the Pirate Isles. Since that time the Sanctorum of the Arcane has been able to create a small amount of this rare powder.
Abilities/Effects: Each pouch of this dust contains enough for 1 use. As an action, you can pour this dust on an area or object and cast the antipathy spell (save DC 23) on it. This action takes 1 hour. After you have used the last of the dust, the pouch loses all magical properties.
Earring of Awareness
Wondrous item, rare
Description: This item is a small silver earring shaped as a whorled seashell, such as a conch or whelk. When worn, the shell augments your hearing, allowing you to hear one specific conversation in a crowded inn, or even eavesdrop on private discussions occurring in the corner.
History: Many are the people that visit Sweet Savona every day, and deep is the intrigue that lies beneath the city’s carefree veneer. Sweet Savona, so called for the ever-present scent of incense, is renowned for its festivals and dedications to Larissa, Goddess of Passion. Indeed, 
merchants, nobles, and peasants alike flock to the City of Joy to partake of its delights, pleasures and sins.
Like all cities, Savona does have a business side. With so many visitors from across the Known Lands passing through its gates every day, it’s naïve to think the city is all pleasure and no work. Business deals are transacted in darkened warehouses or across tables in smoky tavernas.
Because there is such high merchant traffic through the city, a few enterprising artificers began crafting small baubles to aid in these dealings.
Abilities/Effects: While this earring is worn you gain advantage on all Wisdom (Perception) checks dependent upon hearing.
As an action, you may focus your hearing on a particular spot you can clearly see within 30 feet. You can hear anything that would be audible from that spot as if you were physically there. While focusing on this spot, you suffer a -5 penalty to your passive Perception and disadvantage to all Wisdom (Perception) checks on anything that is not specific to the area you are attempting to listen to. You can focus your hearing for up to 10 minutes. Once used, this ability may not be used again until the next dawn.
Eelskin Cloak
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
Description: Each cloak is fashioned from vertical strips of eel hide and lined with oiled sheep-skin for a modicum of comfort. Unfortunately, there is no way to disguise the rancid fish smell that lingers around the cloak. It is easy to spot someone wearing one of these cloaks, due to the conspicuous open space that surrounds them in crowds, rather than because of the cloak’s unusual silver color.
History: The precise origins of these cloaks are shrouded in mystery. They almost certainly originated with the Undir of the Western Lands, though where they got them none can say. Some scholars believe they were given these items as a gift by the elorii of Entaris, while others point to their legendary undine ancestors. Regardless, despite their smell, these cloaks are highly prized among Undir fishermen. Indeed, some Undir fishermen wear non-magical eelskin cloaks as a sign of their dedication to their craft. Such an act shows devotion to the sea above social niceties. 
Abilities/Effects: While this cloak is worn you have resistance against lighting damage and advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks while under water. While wearing this cloak out of the water you suffer disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks and give advantage to anyone attempting to locate you though scent.
Additionally, while wearing this cloak you gain the ability to cast the shocking grasp cantrip, using Dexterity as your spellcasting ability.
Eloisa’s Dancing Shoes
Wondrous item, very rare
Description: These black veldt shoes have a pair of green silk straps that tie up to the knee.
History: Prince Rogan of Milandir, great-uncle to King Osric II, was known as a womanizer and a scoundrel. Despite his reputation,
Rogan was at least careful to keep his trysts and sordid affairs out of the court, so as to not embarrass the other members of the Royal Family. However, one of these affairs became rather conspicuous.
A young courtesan from Savona, Eloisa Gevane, caught Rogan’s eye. The two began to meet secretly late at night as a playful tryst, but eventually fell in love. Unwilling to keep their romance a secret any longer, Rogan invited Eloisa to a ball as his partner and gave her a pair of wonderful dancing shoes made of the finest veldt and green silk. The reaction of the court was swift and unmerciful. Amidst shouts of outrage and derision, he and Eloisa were forced to leave the ball, shamed and humiliated.
Abilities/Effects: While wearing these shoes you have a +1 bonus to you AC, advantage on all Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks, and advantage on Charisma (Performance) checks made while dancing.
Everburning Coal
Wondrous item, uncommon
Description: This lump of coal glows red-hot without ever extinguishing or being consumed and is usually found in a tin censer.
History: The first everburning coals were created by the Nierites during the Theocracy of the Cleansing Flame. To possess and carry one of these coals showed devotion to Nier and to the Theocracy. Conversely, those not possessing the coals were viewed with suspicion. After the fall of the Sword of the Heavens these items were treated with disgust, but soon enough their general usefulness won out. While some Nierites still carry these coals as signs of devotion, for the most part 
they are prized for purely utilitarian reasons, particularly among those who travel in the wilderness. It is rare to find a legion without at least a half-dozen of these items on hand to assist in rapid preparation of meals while on the move.

Eyepatch of the Corsair
Description: This eyepatch is an oval piece of black leather secured to the wearer's face by long black thong. In the center of the patch are red glyphs that glow menacingly.
History: The infamous Armind One-Eye sailed the Pale Sea in his ship the Corruptor for over two decades. Launching out of the city of Freeport, Armind plied his trade, cutting a bloody swath through merchant fleets and dragging the
wretched prisoners to Garundi to sell for slaves. Armind’s fierce countenance, scars crisscrossing his face and a ruined left eye, struck fear in the hearts of his enemies. In return for services rendered, Ymandrake artificers crafted an eyepatch to compensate for his loss. This patch and his bloodthirsty reputation as scourge of the seaways earned Armind his nickname “One- Eye”.
Abilities/Effects: You must wear this eye patch over an empty eye-socket to gain any of its benefits or use any of its effects. While this eyepatch is worn, you gain advantage to Dexterity (Acrobatics) and Wisdom (Survival) checks while sailing.
As an action, you may cast fear (save DC 16). Once you use this ability, it cannot be used again until the next

Eyes of Arcane Sight
Wondrous item, very rare
Description: These dark tinted lenses, set in an ivory frame, are said to have been created by Nurion val’Assante. 
History: The legendary Nurion val’Assante created these lenses sometime after he had established the Sanctorum of the Arcane. Sanctums were often marked with arcane sigils only visible to those with the magical gift, as a precaution against the Harvesters. Unfortunately, this made it very difficult on Nurion’s non-mage allies in the Coryani Senate, whose funding and support were desperately needed. To solve this problem, Nurion created these lenses. Nurion hoped his creation would bring about a closer understanding and kinship between mages and non-mages. In actuality, these items are most sought after by senators and other rich citizens to give to their bodyguards, to protect them from magical attack. Thus, they are often another sign of fear and suspicion against mages.
Abilities/Effects: These lenses have 3 charges. While worn over the eyes, as an action you can expend 1 charge to cast one of the following spells, using your spell save DC detect magic, see invisibility, arcane sight. These lenses regain 1d3 charges daily at dawn.
See Chapter Nine for the new spell, arcane sight.
Fan of the Courtesan
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
Description: Painted silk and stretched over a silver frame, this lustrous fan is in great demand in Sweet Savona.
History: Originally crafted by the 5th century Imperial Arcanist Ipicon, this fan was a gift to the legendary Savonan courtesan Sashastra. The truth of Sashastra’s life is hidden behind a maze of rumors, half-truths and outright lies, but the greatest mystery remains her death. Any of her many lovers could have murdered the alluring courtesan, but many believe she was murdered by either His Holy Patriarch Cartalla or Emperor Lucian val Assante with the very fan that made her famous.
Abilities/Effects: While this fan is held open before your face, you have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) and Charisma (Deception) checks. This fan has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the fan’s last charge, roll a d20.
On a roll of 1, the fan loses all magical properties and crumbles to dust.
You may use your action to expend 1 charge to cast one of the following spells, using your spell save DC: charm person, disguise self, or suggestion.
 
Fan of Voice Throwing
Wondrous item, uncommon
Description: These paper and wooden fans, usually undecorated, are a commonlyemployed by many traveling performers.
History: In the back-country of Onara, troupes of gnomish nomads often put on traveling shows for needed coin. They cannot perform in the big cities, where they are generally driven out of everywhere but the worst slums, but in the country they can sometimes find a sympathetic audience. Even here, though, it is not uncommon for a group of humans to turn hostile. In such situations, the gnomes will turn to trickery, and one of the tricks in their arsenal is the fan of voice throwing. Many gnomish troupe leaders carry such a fan, and are adept at throwing the right phrase to the right place in order to distract an angry mob long enough to pack up the wagons and escape. Tales of how these fans were first created are as varied and colorful as the gnomish performers themselves.
Abilities/Effects: This fan has 6 charges and regains 1d4+1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the fan’s last charge, roll a d20. On a roll of 1 this fan loses all magical properties and crumbles to dust. When this fan is held open in front of your lips, as a bonus action you may expend 1 charge to throw your voice to a location within 30 feet of you that you can see. Anyone who can hear your voice may attempt a Wisdom saving throw (DC 18) to recognize that the voice originates from you and not from where you threw it to. 
Figurines of Wondrous Power
Wondrous item, rarity by figurine
Description: Each of these figurines is a statuette of a creature, small enough to fit in a pocket.
Abilities/Effects: If you use an action to speak the command word and throw a figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of you, the figurine becomes a living creature. If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn’t enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn’t become a creature.
The creature is friendly to you and your companions.
It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions. The creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It also reverts to its figurine form if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its ability to become a creature can’t be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the figurine’s description.

You cannot control this whale, and it will not necessarily take the most direct route across the water but will not dive if it has creatures on its back. Once it has been used, it cannot be used again until 2 days have passed.

Fins of Yarris
Wondrous item, very rare
Description: These oddly shaped slippers flatten and widen towards the toes to a width of about six inches. They appear to be made from a very tough grayish leather of some unknown sea mammal. They smell of brine, and if someone puts their ear to the opening, they hear the sounds of waves.
History: Officially these slippers were first created by the priesthood of Yarris within the Mother Church sometime during the Imperium of Man, and the scholars agree. Yet there are rumors. Rumors that these slippers were not created under the auspices of the 
Mother Church. Rumors that they predate the Imperium. Rumors that they were first crafted by humans who dwelled on Onara before the Pantheon of Man arrived, and yet nonetheless still worshiped Yarris. Rumors that those who frequently wear these slippers often simply dive into the waters off the coast of Salantis, and are never seen again. Strangely enough the few scholars who have ever given credence to these rumors have either immediately retracted their statements, or have been found to be heretics and liars, and swiftly silenced.
Abilities/Effects:
When worn and submerged in water, these shoes become flippers, giving you a swim speed of 60 feet.
Additionally, you grow a set of gills allowing you to breathe underwater and you
can see through water as if it were normal air.
Lastly, you can speak with any aquatic creature as if you had cast speak with animals.
Fire Beads
Wondrous item, rare
Description: Appearing as a common, unpolished bloodstone, this small scarlet sphere is warm to the touch.
History: The first fire beads were created by the Order of the Emerald Flame for the Sorcerer King, and were used by Ymandragore during the Children’s Crusade. The ability of even the most mundane Ymandrake troops to create explosions went a long way toward their initial victories in that war. As the tide turned, however, many fire beads were recovered by the Coryani. Once the principle behind them was understood, Coryani mages began creating them as well. Today they are found throughout Onara.
Abilities/Effects: When thrown against a solid surface within 30 feet, these beads explode, forcing all creatures within 10 feet to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw.
On a failed save, a creature takes 5d10 fire damage and falls prone, or half as much damage on a successful one.
 
Fire Gloves
Wondrous item, rare
Description: These thick gloves are made from smoky-grey colored leather and are emblazoned with a fine tracery that mimics flames.
History: Fire gloves were first created by Victus
Publius, a Coryani battlemage, secret Nierite, and member of the Order of the Hidden Flame. For some generations, only a few pairs offire gloves existed, and only exclusively within the Order of the Hidden Flame. Then, after the re-integration of worship of Nier into the Mother Church by Emperor Calcestus val’Assante, many "worshipers of Nier in the Coryani Empire became public. In gratitude, they gifted the Emperor with five pairs offire gloves. The Emperor gave three as gifts to favored servants, but he had his artificers study the other two. Since that time, these items have slowly been becoming available throughout the Coryani Empire and beyond. To wear them is considered a badge of honor by Coryani Nierites.
Abilities/Effects: These gloves have 3 charges and regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the gloves’ last charge, roll a d20. On a roll of 1 the gloves lose all magical properties and crumble to dust.
While wearing these gloves, you can expend 1 charge as an action to cast one of the following spells, using Charisma as your spellcasting ability: burning hands, scorching ray, Nier’s blade.
See Chapter Nine for the new spell Nier’s Blade.
Flagon of Conviviality
Wondrous item, rare
Description: A large metal carafe, engraved with depictions of the peace ceremony it was meant to commemorate.
History: The first of these flagons was crafted in Solanos Mor to commemorate the one-hundredth anniversary of peace between the Solani and Encali dwarves. Since that time, replicas of the original have become a common gift of truce between nations and different factions. Many of these items can now be found amongst lost treasure hordes, sacked ruins and other forgotten places, as the flagons have survived the alliances they were crafted to commemorate. 
Abilities/Effects: If you serve wine from this flagon, all creatures within 30 feet must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have their attitudes adjusted one step towards friendly. This effect lasts for 1 hour, upon which time the creature’s attitude returns to its previous state.
Flask of Verdant Glory
Wondrous item, uncommon
Description: This simple ceramic flask, engraved on one side with the holy symbol of Saluwe.
History: In the fourth century Quintina val’Dellenov, a priestess of Saluwe, disappeared in the Golden Boughs of Saluwe. She emerged from the forest’s edgi months later, entirely mad. She carried with her the first flask of verdant glory.
The details of her ravings remain a closely kept secret of the val’Dellenov family, but her madness was declared to be holy, and the potion she carried with her was deemed to be a gift from Saluwe herself. Since that time flasks of the green elixir with its faint smells of mistletoe and honey have become so common that most priestesses of Saluwe carry them.
Abilities/Effects: As an action, you can fill this flask with fresh, clean water or a vial of holy water.
After filling the flask, you can drink it as an action to regain 2dl0 hit points. Once this ability is used, you cannot use it again until the next dawn.
Garment of the Hidden Gift
Wondrous item, rare Description: See below.
History: For centuries the vile Harvesters of Ymandragore have hunted and collected people from the Known Lands who were born with the gift for arcane magic. The Sanctorum of the Arcane was founded to protect those so gifted, so that they might gather and train in safety with their peers. Still, the Harvesters have many means of detecting these arcane manipulators, and a mage outside the shelter of a Sanctorum can fall prey to their traps. As a further precaution, the Sanctorum developed the garment of the hidden gift. The garment’s 
lack of any magical emanations shields the wearer from the scrying of the Harvesters.
Abilities/Effects: This garment can be any article of clothing, from a scarf to a cloak. While wearing this garment, you are under the effects of a nondetection spell.
Gauntlet of Immaculate Defense
Wondrous item, rare
Description: This single gauntlet is forged from metal plates, adorned with black crystals over the knuckles and forearms, and lined with fine black leather. Bound together by black chains, these gauntlets appear to be heavy at first glance, but are as light as leather gloves.
History: The Legio Anguis Reptatus holds claim to the honor of having developed this protective item. However, they now see widespread use amongst the Coryani battlemages who serve within the mighty Legions of Coryan.
Abilities/Effects: While wearing this gauntlet you gain a +1 bonus to your AC.
Gauntlet of the Yh’gi
Wondrous item, rare
Description: These heavy leather gauntlets are colorfully stitched and embroidered with images of soaring raptors.
History: Kio are people of the sky; this is attested to in all their histories. While some may scoff at the idea of sky kingdoms, those who believe the fabled Kio homelands to be real hold up the gauntlet of the Yh’gi as proof. According to legend, these gauntlets were not fashioned on Onara, but rather on the floating sky kingdoms from whence the Kio came. It is said that these falconer’s gloves tap deep into the soul of a Kio, and that the spirit hawk they manifest is not a summoned creature, but rather the manifestation of a Kio’s connection to the sky. The fact that non-Kio can still use these gauntlets does not seem to dissuade the true believers.
Abilities/Effects: While worn, as an action you may call forth a spirit hawk. This creature possesses the regular statistics of a hawk and has resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. Your hawk remains active until it is reduced to 0 hit points or dismissed as a bonus action. You cannot call forth another spirit hawk while you have one active. 
While you are within 100 feet of the hawk you may communicate with it telepathically or use an action to see though its eyes as if they were your own. While looking through your hawk’s eyes you fail all ability checks based on your own sight.
Once you call forth a spirit hawk, you cannot do so again until the next dawn.
Gauntlets of Force
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
Description: These heavy gauntlets typically consist of polished steel plates adorned with iron studs over the knuckles and around the wrists. Closer examination of the leather along the palms will show two designs, which form a complete Rune when both palms are held side by side.
History: Helmut Steinhauer, or Helmut the Fraud as he was later known, first came to prominence in Moratavia in the ninth century. He claimed his life of asceticism and poverty granted him mystical martial arts techniques that allowed him to fire bolts of force from his hands, and he demonstrated this at small villages in the Milandisian countryside. He gathered followers among the credulous, none of whom he showed his abilities, but that did not stop them from signing over their possessions to join his “Order of the Joined Palms”. As his reputation grew, however, those with more experience than Milandisian farmers quickly identified that Helmut’s powers came from the magical gauntlets he wore, and not from any internal discipline or enlightenment. Helmut the Fraud fled with his ill- gotten wealth, but his gauntlets were left behind, and later duplicated by Milandisian artificers.
Abilities/Effects: While wearing these gauntlets, you may fire bolts of force as a ranged weapon attack. You are proficient with these bolts of force which have a range of 20/60 and deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage.
As an action, you may focus the power of both gauntlets upon a single target within range. If you hit your target with a successful ranged weapon attack, your target suffers 5d8 bludgeoning damage and must make a successful DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away from you and fall prone. Once you use this ability you cannot use it again until the next dawn.
Gem of Sarish’s Oath
Wondrous item, very rare
Description: This small green gem is marked with the holy symbol of Sarish.
History: The first gems of Sarish’s oath were created by Jarel, Master-Smith of the dwarven enclave of Encali. Jarel had long been fascinated with the swords created in the nearby enclave of Solanos Mor. He made a number of gems during his studies of the work of the dwarf Master Elebac, in the hopes that he might achieve a synthesis of gem and sword that would lead to the creation of the perfect item. Eventually, Jarel’s jealousy of Elebac’s skill consumed him, and after a botched betrayal of the rival smith, his fingers were permanently crushed by the Reavers of Bealak Gempor. Since that time gems of Sarish’s oath have been created by Jarel’s former apprentices, but none quite match the beauty of the originals.
Abilities/Effects: This gem must be set into the pommel of an edged weapon, requiring a DC 20 Dexterity (jeweler’s tool) or Dexterity (smith’s tools) check. Once set, this gem cannot be removed.
A weapon with this gem becomes a magical weapon. As an action, you may stare at an enemy within 30 feet and cut your own hand with this blade, reducing your hit point maximum by 4. You must also recite “Iswear by my blood and by Sarish that I will slay thee". This focuses the blade on your chosen target.
Every time you strike a creature the blade is focused on, you deal an additional 1d6 force damage. You may not recover the any sacrificed hit points through any means or focus your blade upon a new target until your original target has been killed.
Gerrard’s Luxurious Pavilion
Wondrous item, very rare
Description: On the outside this pavilion appears to be a regular campaign tent and weighs 25 pounds.
History: Gerrard val’Ossan, a Milandisian court mage of some repute, was notorious as a seeker of comfort. Always looking for the easiest way to perform any given task and going out of his way to travel in the most comfortable way possible. When he was forced to go on campaign during the Heretic War, he developed a means by which he could enjoy the comforts of his extensive waterfront estate while in the depths of dreary Canceri. Many copies of this enchanted pavilion were commissioned by rich nobility since that time, who use it to flaunt their status.
Abilities/Effects: By placing this tent on the ground and speaking the command word as an action, the pavilion assembles itself into lavish quarters within 1 minute. The interior of the pavilion consists of four 10-foot by 10-foot rooms, all of which are comfortable and dry, regardless of the weather outside. Each room is furnished with exquisite furniture and accessories (beds, tables, cushions, etc.), and any food stored within the pavilion is kept fresh while the pavilion is not in use.
The pavilion has an AC of12 and 50 hit points. If reduced to 0 hit points, it loses all its magical properties except for its ability to be collapsed. Once collapsed, it cannot be 
assembled again for 7 days, after which time it recovers all its hit points and can be used as normal.
Girdle of Marok
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
Description: This belt is made from hundreds of tiny granite plates that are magically held together to form a band of moving stone.
History: The
elorii of Belestor crafted five great artifacts, one for each of their gods during the height of their empire. For Marok, the greatest Marokene artificers crafted a girdle that granted tremendous power over the element of earth. While only one such artifact was ever created, and subsequently lost in the fall of Belestor, it inspired elorii artificers to create the girdles of Marok in lesser imitation. Because the original girdle was lost during the Great Betrayal, these items became symbols of what the Elorii had lost to the humans. The Marokene who sacked the First City at the fall of the Theocracy of the Cleansing Flame wore girdles of Marok proudly during their inexorable march of vengeance.
Abilities/Effects: While wearing this belt, your Strength score becomes 19. This ability has no effect if your Strength is already 19 or higher. In addition, while you are wearing this belt and in direct contact with the earth, you gain resistance to acid damage.
Girdle of the Grand Gladiator
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunementj
Description: This girdle is made of seven steel and gold alloyed plates, each embossed with scenes from the victories of the gladiator for whom it is made, and set with precious gemstones on a belt of mesh. This belt is truly glorious to behold.
 
History: It was Carrok the Black, one of the greatest gladiators ever to bloody the arenas of Sicaris, who commissioned the first girdle of the grand gladiator, engraved with his many victories. Having won his freedom and his fortune many times over, Carrok fought for love of the arena. Fie was a larger-than-life figure, known for his grand theatrics and many public feuds and rivalries with other gladiators, prompting many grudge matches. When Carrok finally retired, one of the few gladiators to do so, others with the means sought to cash in on his fame by having their own girdles made, emblazoned with their own victories. It was these later gladiators that began the tradition of keeping and wearing the girdles of any opponents slain in the arena, thus ensuring the legends of the fallen would never vanish.
Abilities/Effects: As long as you are not wearing any armor, when you wear this belt your AC is equal to 14 + you Dexterity modifier. In addition, you gain advantage on Charisma (Intimidate) checks while this belt is worn.
Gloves of
Arcane Manipulation
Wondrous item, very rare
(requires attunement by an arcane spellcaster)
Description: These plain and undecorated gloves consist of thin leather and seem to lack stitching of any kind, as if they have been created from the flayed skin of someone or something’s hands.
History: It is rare for a magical item to be created by someone without spellcasting talent, but such is the origin of gloves of arcane manipulation. Niloc of Semar was
one of the most prolific archeologists, some would say tomb robbers, ever to be part of the Emerald Society. His many expeditions led to nearly as many near-death experiences. Finally,
weary of constantly being a target for every magical trap devised by an ancient civilization, Niloc began a study of magical artificing to find a way to better protect himself. The result was gloves of arcane 
 
manipulation. It was not until long after Niloc had entered a Myrantian tomb and never returned that spellcasters discovered the gloves’ secondary ability of storing spell levels, something Niloc’s notes referred to as an “odd tingling sensation” that would have to be “fixed in a later design”.
Abilities/Effects: While these gloves are worn, if you are targeted by a spell that only affects you (not a spell with an area of effect) you may, as a reaction, gain advantage on that spell’s saving throw. If you roll a 20 on this saving throw, and the spell is of 5th level or lower, you absorb the spell’s power into your gloves. You may use the absorbed spell’s spell slot, instead of one of your own, for 1 minute. Once these gloves have absorbed a spell they may not do so again until the next dawn.
Gloves of Shadow Storage
Wondrous item, rare
Description: These unremarkable gloves appear to be just other pair of well-worn gloves, except for the inner lining of the palm upon which is inscribed a unique glyph.
History: First appearing in the Shadow Towns of the League of Princes, it is believed that these gloves may have been recovered from an ancient tomb or recovered ssethric treasure trove. Regardless, their clear utility in both larceny and espionage all but guaranteed their reproduction and sale by gifted runesmiths and arcanists alike.
Abilities/Effects: While worn, as a bonus action you can store any item with a weight of up to 10 pounds in a small pocket in the Shadow Plane. You can retrieve this item with another bonus action. Each glove can only hold 1 item at a time. Due to the way these gloves store their items, these gloves may be safely transported through Ansharan portals or even stored extra dimensional spaces such as a bag of holding.
Gloves of
Skillful Manipulation
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
Description: These fine gray gloves are crafted from the softest leather and cover the owner’s hands to the wrist. The leather has been expertly tooled with images of exotic birds.
History: First appearing upon the hands of Nedra of Old Coryan, the exact origin of the gloves remains a mystery. Some speculate that they were a gift from an amorous mage, while others figure they were a payoff from the same source. Nedra’s own origins are also wrapped in mystery, but it is believed that the charismatic raven-haired beauty was born a street urchin. How she spent her early years no one truly knows, but by age 15, she had become one of the most feared members of Old Coryan’s underworld. Nedra dealt in secrets and everyone has something to hide. She was somehow able to steal documents through windows no larger than the documents themselves. Even secure and locked chests were no obstacle. A blackmailer discovered that the padlock on his office chest had been picked, opened, and valuable documents stolen, all with no sign that Nedra had ever entered the room. Footprints were found at the window outside, but the window itself was far too small for even a child to fit through.
By the time she was a young woman, her influence had grown to the point where Emperor Almeric val’Assante offered her a position in the Imperial Court. Nedra was granted lands and title, and upon her deathbed she left all her worldly possessions to her daughter. The family fortune, including the gloves that Nedra so carefully kept secret, have been passed down through the generations.
Abilities/Effects: These gloves have 3 charges. While worn, as an action you may expend 1 charge to conjure a pair of disembodied ethereal gray hands. These hands can appear anywhere within 30 feet of you and mimic the exact movements of your own hands; they even possess a sense of touch. You can perform any tasks or skills you could normally do with your own hands with the disembodied hands except that they cannot attack or lift more than 5 pounds. These hands have a range of 60 feet.
The gloves regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn
Gloves of the Diplomat
Wondrous item, very rare
Description: This item is an ornate pair of white gloves made from the finest calf hide. Patterned in silver thread with the symbol of Sarish, these well-crafted gloves cover the wearer’s hands to wrist. Their true power comes into effect whenever the wearer is involved in a deal of a diplomatic nature.
History: The first pair appeared in the early 11th century on the hands of Rofel Ovidius val’Mehan of Coryan.
Rofel’s sensible words and skills at oration allowed him to rise quickly through the ranks and gain a position of prestige inthe Imperial Court. Rofel’s powers of persuasion were well known, and as a diplomat he had no peer. Emperor Aurelius appointed Rofel ambassador (diplomatic legate) to Canceri, a perilous post that he held for twenty years. Rofel did much to improve relations between the two
col		
Soon after Rofel’s death, these gloves passed on to a new ambassador, Asten Ovidius val’Mehan. Unlike his predecessor, the young, and some would say naive,
Asten quickly fell prey to the machinations of Cancerese politics and has been missing for several years. More recently, these or a similar pair of gloves have been seen

worn by a val’Mehan emissary who was appointed a Coryanidiplomatic legate.
Abilities/Effects: Any time you shake hands with another intelligent creature while wearing these gloves, that creature they must succeed in a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or suffer disadvantage on all Wisdom (Insight) and Charisma (Deception or Persuasion) checks for the next hour when dealing with you and your allies. If they succeed on their save, the creature becomes immune to the glove’s effects for
1	year. Any creatures affected by the gloves must also make a successful DC 18 Intelligence saving throw to become aware of the magical influence of the gloves. If they fail, they are unaware of the gloves’ effects.
Gloves of the Mortis Ceres
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
Description: These bone-white gloves, woven from thick strands of spider silk, come to just above the wrist.
History: The first of these gloves were created during the height of the Myrantian Empire by worshipers of Mahememnun, the Myrantian god of the underworld. When the Second Crusade of Light brought the Myrantians under Coryani rule, these items were discovered by Ventakan Nerothians attached to the Legio Mortis Ceres. Realizing that the Mother Church would consider an item dedicated to a foreign god blasphemous, but not wishing to give up their extensive power, the Nerothians renamed them the gloves of the Mortis Ceres, and claimed to have invented the gloves themselves. Some of these Nerothians later returned to Ventaka, and in the modern day, it is these Nerothians and the priests of Mahememnun of the Abessian Dominion who continue to create the gloves.
Abilities/Effects: These gloves have 3 charges and regain 1d3 expended charges daily at midnight. If you use the gloves’ last charge, roll a d20. On a roll of 1, you gain 1 level of exhaustion and the gloves gain 1 charge as they pull upon your life force to power their effects.
While these gloves are worn, you may expend those charges to use the following abilities.
Feed upon the Soul: You may use an action and expend
2	charges to cast vampiric touch, using Charisma as your spellcasting ability.
Power of Death: While casting a necromantic spell you may expend 1 charge as a bonus action to increase the spell level by 1.
Feed upon the Dead: As a bonus action you may expend 1 charge to cause a single undead with a CR of 1/4 or less within 30 feet of you to be reduced to ash, granting you 10 temporary hit points. These temporary hit points remain for 1 hour.
Gloves of the Scoundrel
Wondrous item, uncommon
Description: These gloves are made of soft and supple black leather that fits snuggly around the wearer’s hands. The back of the gloves is lightly rippled, while the palms are smooth and easy to grip things with.
History: These gloves first became known after a rash of pickpocketing and thievery in Savona. When the gang of thieves was rounded up, it was discovered that they all wore gloves that magically improved their abilities. Several curious artificers attempted to track the gloves’ origins, finally finding the black-market dealer who had first sold the gloves in Savona. He said he had received them from a thief, but that thief was found poisoned. No other evidence was apparent, and the poisoning had all the signs of a professional assassination. Recently the Emerald Society has claimed to have found similar gloves in the ruins of the First City, identical to the Savonan gloves save for their age and the inclusion of an obsidian disk embroidered into the leather.
Abilities/Effects: While worn, these gloves grant advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks and you may cast mage hand.
Gris-Gris Bag
Wondrous item, uncommon or rare
Description: This woven satchel always seems to contain exactly what a hedge mage needs.
History: The gris-gris bag is one of the oldest magic items known, perhaps as old as magic itself. When Sarish first gifted arcane magic to mankind, so says the legend, he gave its secrets to only a chosen few. From these few, five were chosen to wander the land and find other humans worthy of learning the secret power. They each created a woven bag and filled it with whatever useful and magical things they discovered on their journey. By the time their journey was finished, the bags had become magical in their own right. Though the original five bags were lost long before humans came to the Known Lands, their many imitations are still prized among hedge mages.
Abilities/Effects: An uncommon gris-gris bag is considered both an arcane focus and a set of alchemist’s supplies. The rare versions of these bags allow you to reach into the bag as an action and draw forth any uncommon or rare potion, or an alchemical item worth 100gp or less. This item must be used within 1 minute or it crumbles to dust. Once an item is drawn from the bag, you may not draw forth another until the next dawn. 
Hairpins of Prehensile Coiffure
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
Description: These are two long-needle hairpins with enameled butterflies as handles. While worn, the wearer’s hair grows into a thick, luxurious mane of hair that cascades in graceful curls to the small of the wearer’s back.
History: These pins were crafted by the Laerestri Osalikene mage Yanavalas as a gift to her longtime associate, a Larissan priestess whose long curls were shorn during an ill-fated excursion into Canceri. Upon her return to Savona, the use of stylish hairpins caught on and within a year, they were the height of fashion. To this day, it is impossible to find many prosperous ladies of Savona walking the streets with a mundane version of these hairpins.
Abilities/Effects: This hairpin may be used as a magic dagger. While it is worn, you may use an action to cause your hair to grow out up to 10 feet in length and split into 4 independent appendages. These appendages remain active for 5 minutes or until they are reduced to 0 hit points.
Once animated your hair may not be animated again until you complete a long rest.
Your hair appendages are magic bludgeoning weapons with the finesse quality; they deal 1d6 magical bludgeoning damage with a successful attack. Additionally, may spend a bonus action to use your hair appendages while grappling, granting you advantage on all Strength (Athletics) and Dexterity (Athletics) checks made to establish or during a grapple.
Each appendage may be independently targeted and has AC 14, and 20 hit points; they share all your other attributes. You may also use these appendages to perform delicate tasks, such as writing or picking a lock, but these actions are performed with disadvantage.
Harness of Carrying
Wondrous item, uncommon
Description: This sturdy harness of tooled leather is large enough to buckle on over armor.
History: In the sixth century Cael, the newest apprentice to an Encali master smith, grew weary of being constantly used for manual labor and forced to help merchants load crate after crate of her master’s merchandise into wagons. Late at night, and cautiously so as to avoid being caught by her master, Cael created the first harness of carrying. When she defiantly used the harness during the next day’s labor her master was impressed, and reassigned Cael to the workshop where she belonged. He also took credit for Cael’s creation, and became a very wealthy dwarf.
Abilities/Effects: While wearing this harness your Strength score is considered 4 points higher for determining what you can lift or carry.
Harness of Hauling
Wondrous item, very rare
Description: This heavy leather harness is designed to fit around the front of a horse, but can be adapted to any other Medium or Large mount.
History: Found by the Emerald Society explorers in the ruins near sunken Myrantis, it is believed that these harnesses were created by that ancient land’s fell sorcerers. They speculate that it allowed their beasts of burden to move the immense black basalt blocks that make up the cyclopean ziggurats that dot that region.
Abilities/Effects: A beast wearing this harness has their Strength score increased by 2, to a maximum of 20. If you are using the encumbrance variant rule, a beast wearing this harness can carry up to 10 times their Strength before being encumbered and up to 20 times their Strength before being heavily encumbered.
Headband of Delusion
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
Description: This headband is made of pyrite and studded with three pieces of quartz.
History: The age of eloran rule was a time of great peace, but that did not stop Parados, an Ardakene priest, from seeing danger around every corner. His fellow elorii tried to soothe his paranoia, but over the centuries it merely grew stronger. He crafted many items for his protection, but few of them served any useful function. One of the few that did he called the headband of invincibility. He wore it everywhere, but it did not diminish his fears. He died before reaching his first millennium, slain by a bolt of lightning. His most famous creation is now called the headband of delusion, and has become a cautionary tale.
Abilities/Effects: This headband has 3 charges; when the last charge is expended the headband crumbles into dust.
While wearing this headband, you may use an action and expend a charge to gain a limited form of regeneration, healing 5 hit points of slashing, piercing, or bludgeoning damage at the beginning of every turn for 10 turns. Additionally, if you are ever reduced to 0 hit points or less you automatically succeed on your first death saving throw and regain 5 hit points at the beginning of your next turn. 
Headdress of Osalian
Wondrous item, uncommon
Description: A tooled midnight blue leather band, just under an inch wide, circles the head to form this headdress. From each temple, secured by metal clasps, are two feathers. The four feathers are taken from a crow, an eagle, a hawk and an owl. A blue jade talisman hangs over the forehead, depicting the face of an elorii.
History: When Osalian was destroyed, those elorii who worshiped Him lost their divine connection and their spells. For Marithea, one of the most devoted and popular of Osalian’s priesthood, this only increased her devotion to His memory. For centuries she toiled, researching arcane magic to replace the divine magic she had lost, but never failing to continue the rituals of her priestly service to her now-dead lord. Finally, she used her new powers to create the headdresses of Osalian, which are now worn by elorii who, like her, refuse to surrender their faith.
Abilities/Effects: These headdresses possess 4 feathers. While wearing this headdress, you may use an action to pull one of the feathers out of the headdress and cast conjure animals, summoning the type of bird that feather was taken from. You can only have one bird summoned at a time and when a particular feather is used it cannot be used again until the next dawn.
Holiday Hat
Wondrous item, uncommon
Description: Made from straw, and fitted with a band of bird feathers around the brim, the hat both shades the wearer and is stylish. Some hats have feathers solely from one bird, while others have a mixture.
History: Kio tend to have fair complexions that are easily burned by the sun, so they took to wearing broad-brimmed straw hats to protect their faces while on journeys. Because these hats were often used by Kio on religious pilgrimages, they became known as “holiday hats”. Most Kio own such 
a hat, but for Antarn Hallgyphe val’Sungha this was not
enough. She commissioned Phirae Veghellio, the famous Kio artificer, to enchant her holiday hat with further protections against the elements. Since that time Veghellio has created similar items for other Kio nobles, and the holiday hat has gained prominence in Kio fashion.
Abilities/Effects: While this hat is worn you are not subject to the effects of weather. If worn while taking a short rest, you may recover 1 level of exhaustion. Once the hat’s ability to recover from exhaustion is used it cannot be used again until you have completed a long rest.
Holy Symbol of Rage’s Fury
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
Description: Crafted from the blood tinted gold of Canceri, this holy symbol of Nier seems to glow with an eerie crimson radiance and always feels warm to the touch. With its power, the possessor of the amulet may call upon the passion of the soul to ignite
i heir Iuiy.
History: First created by a priest attached to the Legion of Searing Light prior to Canceri secession from the Coryani Empire, the secrets of forging these amulets have slowly spread among the clergy of Nier in Canceri. Today, these amulets are given as awards of honor to soldiers who show bravery in battle.
Abilities/Effects: While this amulet is worn you may use a bonus action to gain a +2 bonus to all melee damage rolls for 1 minute. Once this ability is used you may not call upon it again until you complete a short rest.
Hood of the Cat’s Meow
Wondrous item, uncommon
Description: This hood is fashioned from matted fur and has the texture of felt; it also has triangular patches that resemble feline ears. The color is usually black but sometimes matches the hair color of the crafter or intended wearer of the hood. The hood can be worn with a cape or other outer garment, and it is sometimes found with a cape of feline form.
History: After Gilberta val’Mehan refused the amorous advances of a powerful nobleman she found herself accused of witchcraft and consorting with demons. She fled to the Faerdwalden, where she intended to live a life of quiet 
devotion to Sarish. That changed when she found a badly injured cat at the edge of the woods. Then another. Then more. After nursing them back to health she found herself intrigued by the mystery, and calling upon Sarish’s power she crafted the first hood of the cat’s meow from their matted fur. What she learned from her feline friends led to her becoming the feared Cat Witch of Faerdwalden, who figures so prominently in Milandisian folk legends from the Shadowed Age.
Abilities/Effects: As long as this hood is worn, you possess the ability to speak to felines as if you were under the effects of a continuous speak with animals spell.
Horn of Saluwe’s Bounty
Wondrous item, very rare
Description: Similar to its more common cousin, this ram’s horn is gilded in gold and carved with images of bountiful harvests.
History: These horns T. were also instrumental in lifting the siege of Panari during the Shadowed Age, when the fledgling Tenecian Empire sought to conquer the val’Dellenov stronghold.
Eventually, unable to starve the inhabitants into submission, the Tenecians returned to their lands, defeated. In the modern day, the horns are used to commemorate that ancient victory with an elaborate fete, where rich and poor dine at the same communal table, remembering the hardship their ancestors endured together.
Abilities/Effects: If you speak a prayer to Saluwe and blow this horn you can cast heroes' feast. Once this ability is used it cannot be used again until 7 days have passed.
Horn of Saluwe’s Plenty
Wondrous item, uncommon
Description: This ram’s horn is scrimshawed with images of menageries and gardens. The inside rim of the device is scribed with benedictions to Saluwe, asking for the blessing of her bounty.
History: These items are usually crafted and used by the clergy of Saluwe to relieve areas that are suffering from famine or drought. When not in use, most of these horns are kept in the Temple of Saluwe in Panari.
Abilities/Effects: If you speak a prayer to Saluwe and blow this horn you can cast create food and water. Once this ability is used it cannot be used again until the next dawn.
 
Horn of Terror
Wondrous item, very rare
Description: This horn, carved from a large infernal’s horn, is inlayed in gold and onyx.
History: During the First Crusade of Light many infernal
horns were taken as trophies, and those who took them were spared the wrath of the Inquisition because, separated from their host, they were believed harmless. It was not until the second century that Eligius val’Assante, being a dissolute scion of the family with an unhealthy interest in infernals, dared to take his noble ancestor’s trophy and subject it to magical experiment. The result was the first horn of terror. Few of these horns have been made, and if the Inquisition knew just what materials they were made from, they would certainly try to destroy them. It is said that when the last of the infernals have been vanquished that these horns shall crumble to dust.
Abilities/Effects: As an action you may blow this horn to force all living creatures within 60 feet to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of their next turn. If you possess infernal blood (if you are a dark-kin, for example) the saving throw is increased to DC 19. Once used this ability cannot be used again until the next midnight.
Horn of War
Wondrous item, very rare
Description: This horn appears to be made of a tarnished brass metal, looking as if it were partially made from a piece of charcoal. It can be worn slung over the shoulder on a leather thong.
History: In the latter days of the First Imperium, val’Virdan who specialized in working with war dogs, were known as the Hellhounds. One Hellhound, Cassia val’Virdan, created the first horn of war so she could summon her beloved dogs to her side whenever she chose. To her surprise, her commanders confiscated her creation and told her to remain silent. Their reasoning became clear years later, when the Theocracy of the Cleansing Flame conquered the Imperium, and horns of war were used in the vanguard. These horns are still found among the Erdukeen.
Abilities/Effects: As an action you may blow this horn to produce one of two effects. You may either summon 
 
4 mastiffs as if you had cast conjure animals or you may choose to cast bless (no concentration required) on up to 6 friendly creatures. Once either of these abilities are used, this horn may not be used again until the next dawn.
Horn of Winter
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
Description: This horn is made of enchanted ice, kept perpetually frozen. The ice is as hard as steel, and is elaborately carved and embossed with images of mountains, glaciers and arctic beasts.
History: The first of these horns known in modern times, and the template from which all modern horns of winter were created, was found clutched in the arms of a half-crazed pilgrim who came staggering out of the Blessed Lands. For years, its origin was the subject of much debate, but recent Azure Way efforts in the First City have discovered multiple ssethric records recounting battle with the Cyclopes and describing such horns. That, plus the strange writing on the original horn, point to a cyclopean origin.
Abilities/Effects: While you are attuned to this horn, you gain resistance to cold damage.
As an action, you can blow this horn to cast cone of cold (DC 15). Once this ability is used you may not use it again until the next dawn.
Icon of Spirit Storing
Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement to a location)
Description: These icons are crafted into various shapes, with the most famous being the leering skulls of Enpebyn.
History: The largest collection of these icons located in the city of Enpebyn, until, during the Coryani Civil War, a large portion of the city caved in and fell into the Endless Dark and most of the icons were lost. Each icon represents a single creature and must be specifically made for each creature that is to be bound into it. For example, the icons located in Enpebyn contain the souls of the legionnaires of the Doom of Chendo legion.
Abilities/Effects: These icons can be attuned to a location 
1 mile in diameter and the ritual that attunes the icon to its location traps the soul of an intelligent creature within it. They are designed to fulfill a specific task, such as fighting a fire or defending a city from invaders, which is set when the icon is attuned.
Once the specific condition set during the ritual is met, the icon summons forth a ghost which performs the specified task to the best of its ability. If the ghost is destroyed in combat, then the icon is destroyed with it. It is unknown what happens to a creature’s soul when the icon is destroyed. Some conjecture that having served their time, they are admitted directly to paradise, bypassing the Judgement of Nier, while others claim that they are simply destroyed and do not even face the Judgement. The truth of what happens is liable to never be known.
The icon itself can be of any size and can be destroyed as easily any item of its size and construction. Destroying an icon releases the soul bound within it.
See Location Attunement Sidebar, pg. 103.
Jar of Preservation
Wondrous item, legendary
Description: This thick glass jar comes with a lead stopper. The stopper for each jar is unique, and all bear a different glyph. This glyph is indecipherable, even by magic, and is presumed by scholars to simply be a marking to differentiate between jars.
History: Recent findings by the Azure Way in the labyrinth beneath the First City have finally shed light on the origins of these strange jars. They were encountered by the Ssethregoran armies upon their defeat of the Issori. The Issori were attempting to preserve their larvae within the jars, presumably to resurrect their race at a later date. The Ssethregorans smashed all the jars they found and destroyed the larvae, but they soon learned to recreate the magic items for their own purposes. They remained in use throughout the Yahssremoran Empire, but the knowledge of how to make these items seems to have been lost with the rebellion of the elorii.
Abilities/Effects: Any item placed within this jar enters suspended animation and will not age or decay. Only creatures or items of Tiny or Small size can be stored in the jar. If the jar is broken, anything within is freed and once again subject to the normal passing of time.
Kirtle of Keepsakes
Wondrous item, uncommon
Description: Resembling the type of short coats that are typically worn under cloaks or robes, this magical garment has ten hidden pockets. 
History: All Tevil the haberdasher ever wanted was to be respected in his hometown of Plexus. When he, almost by accident, created the first kirtle of keepsakes, he thought it might finally bring him the honor he wanted. However, few were impressed by what seemed to be mere sleight of hand using hidden pockets, so in frustration Tevil began embellishing his story. With each telling the tale grew grander, until Tevil was rumored to be a secret master of magic whose haberdashery was merely a disguise. Finally, he had the respect he deserved, but not for long. Being a rumored mage is a dangerous thing, and Tevil was harvested from his home one night.
With no
actual magical gift to bargain with,
Tevil met his end at the hands of an Ymandrake interrogator.
Abilities/Effects: This shirt possesses 10 cleverly hidden pockets. While worn you easily find these pockets, but anyone else must succeed at a DC 25 Intelligence (Investigation) check to locate them. Each pocket can hold one item the size of a potion vial, or you may split up one set of small tools (such as thief’s tools) into 3 pockets.
Lantern of Restless Warding
Wondrous item, very rare
Description: This hooded lantern is made from steel that has been plated with hammered white-gold sheets.
History: After the Cult of the Thousand-Eyed Man arose during the reign of Eladru val’Assante, the Inquisition realized they needed an order of elite inquisitors able to deal with the ghastliest of heresies. Thus, they founded the Praecelsus Quaestor Lumens, the High Seekers of the Light. Lanterns of restless wardingsNfztfz first created for these elite inquisitors,
 
to illuminate the dark places and to ward against infernals. Since the death of Felician val’Mehan the order has dwindled, and now numbers less than one hundred, while most of the lanterns have been lost.
Abilities/Effects: When lit and the hood opened, this lantern sheds bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light 60-feet beyond that.
As an action, you may set the lantern down and pour a vial of holy water into the lantern to cast magic circle (affecting infernals, save DC 16), centered on the lamp.
If you move the lantern, the effect ends. Once used, this ability cannot be used again until the next dawn.
Lantern of the Archaeologist
Wondrous item, rare
Description: This large, bronze, hooded lantern is ornate, with an inscription etched into the inside of the lens hood. Bronze birds with outstretched wings decorate either side of the lantern.
History: It is no surprise that these lanterns were first created by the Emerald Society, though perhaps the motives behind their creation is more curious. A particularly secretive sect within the Emerald Society sought to ensure that no spies could steal their discoveries, and so they created a vault protected by cleverly hidden traps and riddles in obscure languages. They then made the first of these lanterns to give to their inner circle, with the idea that only someone
KELB'BAKARI
LIGHTS THE WAY
WITH THE LANTERN
OF THE ARCHEOLOGIST 
with such a lantern could avoid the traps and interpret the riddles. So secure were they in this belief that they let other security grow lax, and they were soon robbed blind by a particularly skilled thief.
Abilities/Effect: This lantern has 3 charges and regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While this lantern is lit, as an action you may use 1 charge to cast either comprehend languages or find traps with an area of effect limited to the area illuminated by the lantern’s bright light.
Larissa’s Coin
Wondrous item, uncommon
Description: This is a small gold coin with the visage of Larissa smiling on one side and frowning on the other.
History: When the first Fatespinner revealed herself to the Larissan clergy, they were skeptical. Clearly the Fatespinner had martial ability, and some skill with divine magic, but how could she prove that she was truly connected to the web of fate? The Fatespinner proposed a test. A gold coin stamped with Larissa’s visage was brought, a skeptical Larissan called smile or frown in the air, and the Fatespinner manipulated the strands of fate to make it land accordingly. Time and time again she demonstrated this, finally proving her ability. The coin, so frequently subject to manipulation of the strands of fate, absorbed some of the Fatespinner’s own power, becoming the first Larissa’s coin.
Abilities/Effects: You may flip this coin as an action while willing it to alter your fate. The GM flips a coin, with you calling heads or tails. The GM then makes note of the result without informing you. If your call was correct, you automatically roll a 20 on your next saving throw. If you called it incorrectly, you automatically roll a 1 on your next saving throw. Once thrown, this coin may not be used again until the next dawn.
Laurel of Glory
Wondrous item, very rare
Description: This laurel wreath appears to be made of pure gold but is as strong as iron and very light. It may be worn alone or attached to helm.
History: One of the highest honors that may be granted to a citizen of the Coryani Empire, the laurel of glory is awarded for acts of selflessness, and fearlessness in the defense of the Empire. Those who wear these laurels will find that they are given deference by both plebian and noble alike.
Abilities/Effects: While this laurel is worn you gain advantage on all saving throws to avoid gaining the charmed or frightened condition.
When while acting in the direct defense of the Coryani
Empire and its citizens (such as fighting a foreign invader or defending a member of the senate from assassination) you may cast bless upon yourself as a bonus action. Once this ability is used you may not use it again until the next dawn.
Duty Above All (Requires Attunement): Once attuned to this item you may not end that attunement unless targeted by the remove curse spell. You have advantage on all attack rolls made to directly defend the sitting Emperor of Coryan or a sitting member of the Imperial Senate, even when not wearing the laurel. If you ever attack (even unwillingly) the sitting Emperor of Coryan or a sitting member of the Imperial Senate you suffer 10d6 psychic damage and the laurel crumbles to dust.
Legionnaire’s Crest
Wondrous item, uncommon
Description: These brilliantly colored red crests are used to adorn the helms of Coryani's most dedicated legionnaires.
History: The first legionnaire’s crests were created not for the Coryani Empire, but during the latter days of the Imperium of Man. The Imperator commanded crests be made for each and every soldier in his legions, a staggering expense that only confirmed the decadence of the Imperator and sparked unrest among his people. When the Imperium fell, the crests became a symbol of the corruption of the old regime. All that were found were burned at the command of the Sword of the Heavens, and the few that survived the flames were lost during the Shadowed Age. The secret of their creation was rediscovered in the second century, and the crests are now a signature item of the Coryani legions.
Abilities/Effects: While this crest is attached to a helm you are wearing, as an action you may cast enhance ability upon yourself. Once used, you cannot use this ability again until you have completed a short or long rest.
Duty Above All (Requires Attunement): Once attuned to this item you may not end that attunement unless targeted by the remove curse spell. You have advantage on all attack rolls made to directly defend the sitting Emperor of Coryan or a sitting member of the Imperial Senate, even when not wearing the laurel. If you ever attack (even unwillingly) the sitting Emperor of Coryan or a sitting member of the Imperial Senate you suffer 10d6 psychic damage and the crest crumbles to dust.
Legionnaire’s Pin
Wondrous item, rare
Description: This pin is shaped like a falcon in flight.
History: This is a pin granted to legionnaire’s who go above and beyond the call of duty, risking their lives and exemplifying the ideals of the Empire. 
Abilities/Effects: While this pin is worn you gain advantage on all saving throws to avoid gaining the charmed or frightened condition.
Duty Above All (Requires Attunement): Once attuned to this item you may not end that attunement unless targeted by the remove curse spell. You have advantage on all attack rolls made to directly defend the sitting Emperor of Coryan or a sitting member of the Imperial Senate, even when not wearing the laurel. If you ever attack (even unwillingly) the sitting Emperor of Coryan or a sitting member of the Imperial Senate you suffer 10d6 psychic damage and the pin crumbles to dust.
Lord Anesche’s Bags
Wondrous item, rare or very rare
Description: These sets of bags, each weighing approximately 15 pounds, appear to be made of fine velvet, and are often crafted with an embroidered symbol unique to the owner of these bags. One of the set, known as the master bag, additionally has gold-inlayed rope to tie it shut.
History: The first set of these bags was created soon after the Blessed Lands were re-opened to pilgrims. An enterprising merchant realized that, with these bags, he could keep most of his stock safely locked away in his wagon, while producing whatever items he wished to sell from the personal bag he carried. It did not take long for other merchants to seek similar bags, and then for smugglers and spies to see the possibilities. In the eighth century, a spy within Quron val’Dellenov’s palace used these bags to pass messages to a Khitani agent outside the palace walls. Since that time many nations have become wary of these bags, and have sought wards which disrupt their abilities.
Abilities/Effect: These bags are always found in sets of ld6+l with one, usually the finest looking bag of the set, being the “master” bag. Each bag is roughly 2 feet in diameter at the mouth and 4 feet deep.
You can reach into any of the bags and pull out an item from any bag in the set that is within 100 feet. If any of the bags are overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures and is destroyed, immediately removing it from the set. If the master bag is destroyed all bags in the set revert to simple non-magical bags.
The very rare version of this item shares all of the same properties as the rare version, but it has no master bag. As such, in order to destroy a set of these bags, every bag has to be destroyed.
 
Lord Khidath’s Guard
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
Description: Inscribed with ancient Altharin writing, this Auxunite armor first appears as a wide golden collar that expands into light, flanged armor and helm when the command word is spoken.
History: Worn by one of the most feared warlords of the Auxunite Empire, Lord Khidath ruled over large swaths of modern day Milandir. The Milandisians, led by the val’Tensen family, attempted to assassinate their cruel overlord over a hundred times, but failed due to this armor’s enchantment.
Abilities/Effects: While this collar is worn, as a bonus action you may use the collar to manifest a suit of armor. This armor grants you an Armor Class of 15 + your Dexterity modifier (to a maximum of +2) and darkvision to 60 feet.
This collar may be activated for a total of 10 minutes before the magic in it ceases to function. These 10 minutes do not need to be consecutive, but must be activated for a minimum of 1 minute at a time. Once all 10 minutes have been used the collar ceases to function until you finish a long rest. 
Lyde’s Veil of Persuasion
Wondrous item, rare
Description: This veil consists of a fine mesh of white lace attached to a comb headpiece.
History: The sorceress Vorena val’Assante created this veil as a gift for her sister Lyde, who had ambitions of becoming a senator. Lyde at first refused to compromise her ideals by resorting to such tricks, and with her own skill she became the first woman to serve on the Imperial Senate. However, her fellow senators treated her as a political prop, and gave no heed to a woman’s arguments, no matter how sound. Thus, she remembered her sister’s gift. For more than a decade Lyde val’Assante was one of the most respected politicians on the senate, the veil ever present on her face whenever she was in public. More than once it was commented on that it always seemed to complement the dress she had chosen that day. One day Lyde val’Assante disappeared without a trace. Her home was in order with nothing out of place, save one thing; her veil was nowhere to be found.
Abilities/Effects: While this veil is worn you have advantage on all Charisma (Deception or Persuasion) and Wisdom (Insight) checks. This veil has 3 charges, and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.
While wearing this veil, you can use your action to expend 1 charge to cast charm person (save DC 13) on a humanoid you can see within 30 feet of you.
Maliar’s
Magnificent Laboratory
Wondrous item, rare
Description: At first glance this miniature house seems like nothing more than a well-made child’s plaything.
History: Maliar val’Sheem, Mage-Alchemist of Milandir, built a laboratory on the shores of the Gulf of Yarris so she could complete her master work. No sooner had she begun, however, then her laboratory was destroyed in the conflict between Ymandragore and King Osric I of Milandir. Maliar was displaced and moved inland, but her second laboratory was destroyed by encroaching Yhing hir barbarians several years later, again destroying all her research. Spurred by these frustrating events, Maliar vowed to create a laboratory that no army could destroy. After more years of research, and losing a third laboratory to a freak accident, she succeeded in creating the first of her magnificent laboratories.
Abilities/Effects: You can use an action to place this small toy house on the ground and speak its command word.
This toy home rapidly grows into a 20 ft. by 20 ft. by 15 ft. tall one story building. You may also you use an action to speak the command word that shrinks the building back to it’s toy size, which works only if no one is within. This small home consists of 3 rooms, one of which is a full laboratory that has alchemist’s supplies, glassblower’s tools, an herbalism kit, and a poisoner’s kit.
When activated, the building has a small door on the side facing you. The door opens only at your command. It is immune to the knock spell and similar magic, such as a chime of opening or skeleton key.
Each creature in the area where the home appears must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In either case, the creature is pushed to an unoccupied space outside but next to the house. Objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried take this damage and are pushed automatically.
The building is made of impossibly strong stone and wood. The roof, the door, and the walls each have 75 hit points, immunity to damage from nonmagical weapons excluding siege weapons, and resistance to all other damage. Mailer’s magnificent laboratory can only be repaired by casting mending and expending a 9th level spell slot, which restores the laboratory to full hit points.
Manacles of Ymandragore
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
Description: These appear like normal, heavy iron manacles, but glowing red runes appear when they are placed on any who can channel arcane power.
History: When he withdrew to Ymandragore, the Sorcerer King crafted the first manacles himself. Knowing he would need servants beyond the pathetic wretches that resided upon the Isle of Tears, he sought out a powerful mage and lured her to his lair. As she prepared her spells to escape, he bound her in the manacles and all power fled from her. Recognizing the superior skill of the one who had crafted her bindings, she swore herself to him. He gave her the manacles, and declared her to be his first Harvester — or so the legend goes. Since that time there have been many more Harvesters, and many more manacles; both are feared by the mages of Onara.
Abilities/Effects: When placed upon a creature, they instantly become attuned to the manacles, breaking any attunement that creature may have to other items. The attuned creature instantly loses 10 spell slots, and loses an additional 10 spell slots at the beginning of each of their turns until they have no spell slots remaining. As long as these manacles are worn, the creature cannot regain any spell slots through any known means and suffer 6d6 force damage any time they attempt to cast any spell or cantrip.
Once locked, the individual who placed the manacles 
on the creature may unlock them as an action with the use of a command word. They may also be unlocked with a successful dispel magic (treat the manacles as a 5th level spell) or successful DC 20 Dexterity (thieves’ tools) check.
Mask of Death
Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)
Description: This alabaster stage mask is carved to look like death’s head, carved flesh stretched taut over the bones of the lurid and hungry grin of the skull beneath. There is a black coif that attaches by small silver clasps to the back of the mask, covering the entire head.
History: The tales told about Drusilla val’lVlordane are more legend than history. It is said Neroth blessed her birth, but Cadic’s Troupe of the Final Note held her devotion. She was a musician of unparalleled skill, but her tunes were melancholy and the alabaster death mask she wore hid her features.
It was she who played for the court of Eladru val’Assante the very night three of his advisors were found dead, with evidence of their planned treason against the Emperor on their corpses.
Her mask has seen use by the Troupe since her time, on rare missions of vital importance. It is unknown how many such masks the Troupe possesses.
Abilities/Effects: This mask has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at midnight. If you expend the mask’s last charge, roll a d20. On a roll of 1 you suffer 1 level of exhaustion and the mask regains 1 expended charge as it greedily feeds upon your life force.
While this mask is worn, you may use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast following spells: fear (1 charge, save DC 15), finger of death (2 charges, save DC 16).
Mask of Larissa’s Blessing
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
Description: This mask appears as a solid gold mask carved with fine facial features. The left eye opening is surrounded by deep purple gemstone inlays reminiscent of tears, while a sunburst is etched about the right. Upon the burnished forehead is a glyph of pure silver. The mask covers the 
wearer’s entire face, even her mouth, where perfectly formed full lips are crafted into a petulant pout.
History: The first of these masks was created and worn by Serena Jiuldan of Sweet Savona, a high priestess of Larissa.
She served for many years in the temple to Larissa, leading a relatively peaceful, yet intrigue ridden, life. In her early thirties, Serena organized a caravan to Mil Takara to purchase rare herbs and compounds found nowhere else in the Known Lands. The purchase went smoothly, and the priestesses of Larissa left Mil Takara with mules laden with the precious herbs.
During the return trip to Sweet Savona, a band of thieves and cutthroats descended upon the sleepy caravan. Shouts went up from sentries, and soon the entire camp was in chaos. Brigands were everywhere looting treasure and taking slaves. The numbers were overwhelming, and soon the thieves had ringed the last tent, where Serena stood bravely at the head of her fellow priestesses. Serena looked out in dismay at the crowd of drooling savages, and raised her arms to the heavens. Calling upon the will of Larissa, Serena cursed the brutal raiders for their greed and savagery. Taking the golden mask from her face, she threw it into the dust before the brigands. In a booming voice, she cried out “Leave this place now you fools, or suffer the wrath of the gods for your greed”, and with that the head priestess of Larissa slumped to the ground in exhaustion.
The bloodthirsty marauders laughed at the priestess and then turned their gaze upon the solid golden mask. As one they surged forward, intent on finishing off' the survivors, and plunder their riches. As the first bandit reached the mask, there was a roar of thunder and a brilliant flash of light. A smoking hole appeared where the raider had stood. Seeing this, the raiders turned to flee, but it was too late. Soon the entire valley was lit with coruscating bolts of lightning. The raiders were incinerated where they stood, as the divine power of Hurrian reached down to protect His sister’s devoted followers. The priestesses quickly packed their scattered supplies and fled. No one, not even Serena, dared to retrieve the mask of Larissa’s blessing which lay upon the ground.
Abilities/Effects: While you wear this mask your Charisma score is increased to 19. If you already possess a Charisma of 19 or greater you gain no benefit. Additionally, while you wear this mask, you may cast augury at will. You do not require material components to cast this spell.
You may, as an action, cast this mask to the ground and gain 1 level of exhaustion to cast call lightning (save DC 17). 
Mask of Steely Countenance
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
Description: This is a full mask of silver-etched ivory carved to resemble an expressionless face. The mask is tied with a simple cord of homespun wool, dyed a deep red.
The interior of the mask is covered in prayers, in sepia-ink, dedicated to Hurrian.
History: When Milandir left the Coryani Empire, the val’Tensen family was split down the middle. To secure the border, Augustos val’Tensen, newly made Duke of Moratavia, had to hold off his former brethren. But his counterpart in Ulfila had the friendship of the Larissan temple, who sent him oracles to predict Duke Augustos’ actions. In desperation, the Duke turned to the loyal Milandisian priesthood of Hurrian, who crafted blank masks for the Duke and his officers to wear to hide their plans. With this new advantage the Coryani were driven back and the border secured.
Abilities/Effects: While wearing this mask, you are permanently under the effects of a nondetection spell. You also gain advantage on all saving throws against effects that read your mind or discern your emotional state. Finally, anyone attempting to discern your motives through the use of a Wisdom (Insight) check does so at disadvantage.
Mask of the Petrified Goddess
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
Description: This is an oval mask carved from greenstone in the visage of a horrible, scowling medusa. It is adorned with burnished coral, a bundle of emerald serpents for hair and a golden circle set with glittering jewels upon its brow. When the mask is donned it becomes pliant and fleshy, hugging the wearer’s face as the serpent locks transform into living snakes and begin to writhe and hiss menacingly. Rumor holds that this item was first created by the diabolical priestess Amedhi-Gesu.
History: There are no records of these masks before the Blessed Lands were reopened in the early days of the Coryani Empire, and even since 
then they are rarely found, and always in the southeast of the Blessed Lands near the petrified forest. Local tribes speak of men who go mad and flee into the forest, only to return months or years later wearing a mask and embarking on some terrible, destructive purpose. In recent years an old Erdukeen, who had marched with the Sword of the Heavens into the Blessed Lands, donned a magical mask of his own creation, killed twelve people, and petrified another before he was put down. His mask was identical to the ones found near the Petrified Forest, down to the intricately carved snakes.
Abilities/Effects: While wearing this mask you can animate the snakes on the mask as a bonus action and use them to make melee weapon attacks, treating them as magical daggers. Those bitten by the snakes must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. Additionally, while worn you may use an action to can cast flesh to stone (save DC 15). Once this ability is used it cannot be used again until the next dawn.
Mask of the Voei Witchdoctor
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
Description: These masks are elaborately carved to appear as fiendish creatures of nightmare. Typically, they are carved from tree bark or stone, although the witchdoctors of the larger tribes have been known to craft them from pure fervid ite.
History: Within a decade of the conclusion of the second Coryani-Khitani war, the Voei had grown even more aggressive, and survivors reported their warped barbarians were now led by masked witchdoctors. It is believed that the Voei recovered magic items from the battlefields of the war and, despite their savagery, were able to gain a crude understanding of their workings. They then turned this knowledge to their own purposes, and created the masks of the Voei witchdoctor. The pilgrims of the Blessed Lands mutter that 
this is just one more consequence of the schism between the nations of Man.
Abilities/Effects: While you wear this mask you gain advantage on all Charisma (Intimidation) checks. This
mask has 3 charges, and regains ld3 expended charges daily at midnight.
As an action, you may expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells: bane (1 charge, save DC 15), bestow curse (2 charges, save DC 15).
Mirror of Minions
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement to a location [room])
Description: This large oval glass mirror is set into a silver stand. The two upright poles that support the mirror are cunningly worked to resemble a stylized man and woman, holding it at waist height.
History: The first of these were commissioned by Emperor Quron val’Dellenov for his Palace of Mirrors. The palace was built during the months leading up to the insurrection that saw Canceri, Milandir and Altheria secede from the Empire. By the time the palace was finished, Emperor Quron had already been executed and replaced. However, it was too late; his madness had cost the Empire dearly.
The palace was abandoned and overrun by squatters before being partially gutted by fire in 905 I.C. Most of the mirrors were destroyed either by the squatters or the fire, but some precious few survived.
Abilities/Effects: This mirror can be attuned to any room of no more than 100 square feet. Once the mirror is attuned, you can use an action to look into the mirror causing it to produce 8 illusionary doubles that last for 1 hour. The duplicates move with you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it’s impossible to track which image is real. You can use your action to dismiss 1 or more of the illusory duplicates.
As long as you have at least one illusory duplicate remaining, each time a creature targets you with an attack, determine randomly whether the attack instead targets one of your duplicates. A duplicate’s AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier. If an attack hits a duplicate, the duplicate is destroyed. A duplicate can be destroyed only by an attack that hits it. It ignores all other damage and effects. The effect ends when all duplicates are destroyed.
A creature is unaffected by this effect if it can’t see, if it relies on senses other than sight, such as blindsight, or if it can perceive illusions as false, as with truesight. Once this ability is used, the mirror cannot be used to create these illusionary doubles until the next dawn.
See Location Attunement Sidebar, pg. 103.
 
Missive
Wondrous item, uncommon
Description: This delicate construct is made of cloth and
wood, and is used by divine spellcasters as a means of sending messages or magical aid to distant fellows. They are often used to link the sanctums of the various cults and temples in the Blessed Lands. Superficially, the missive resembles a bird or bat and is usually painted with its
creator’s symbol of faith.
History:
The first missive was created by Fotini val’Abebi in the latter days of the Imperium, just in time to assist in coordinating evacuation as the fabled civilization fell. During the Shadowed Age the Altherians kept the secret of the construct, using it among themselves. As they began to build their nation, networks of missives were established to foster communication. It is said that the skies above Khafre swarmed with them. Afterwards use of missives diminished, as Altherians sought for a time to be less ostentatious with their technological wonders, but they are still frequently used in the Shining Patrol. In addition, a number of missives were gifted to the Mother Church for use in the Blessed Lands.
Abilities/Effects: Commonly dormant, the missive awakens when a divine spellcaster touches it and expends a spell slot, channeling the energy of the spell into animating the small construct. Once animated, any time within the next hour you may give the small construct a set of simple instructions and place a package in its storage container.
You must send the construct to a location it has been to before and you must describe who to deliver the message or package too.
The construct will do its best to fulfill your instructions, unerringly returning to you after completion. If the missive is unable to meet with your instructions, it will also return to you and tell you why it was unable to fulfill its instructions. Regardless of its success or failure once the missive returns to you it goes dormant once more.
Secure Storage: A missive has a small container built into it, a few cubic inches in volume, which is able to carry a few ounces of messages or cargo, such as a potion or a scroll. More weight will prevent the construct from flying. If the 
missive is ever captured by a third party, it may choose to destroy any non-magical item within its compartment as a reaction.
Mockingbird Collar
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
Description: This is a braided leather choker with a mockingbird feather at its center.
History: Iona of Plexus loved Florine, but Florine was married to the powerful and cruel Phocas Servius, who kept Florine imprisoned under guard. Iona crafted the mockingbird collar to allow her to imitate Phocas’s bellow when she stole into Florine’s room. She would then order that the guards not to disturb them in Phocas’s voice. Thus, they were able to spend precious
 
moments together, whispering words of love and planning their escape. Sadly, Phocas discovered their plans, and murdered Florine in a jealous rage. In despair Iona threw herself into the Gulf of Coryan and drowned. Her mockingbird collar later washed up on shore, where it was recovered, studied, and duplicated by others.
Abilities/Effects: While this collar is worn you gain the ability to imitate the voice of anyone you have heard speaking. Tuning the collar to a particular voice requires an action. Once tuned, for the next hour, your voice sounds identically to the voice you chose to emulate. This grants you advantage on all Charisma (Performance) checks while attempting to disguise yourself as the person whose voice you are imitating.
Monkey Gloves
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
Description: These well-crafted gloves are made from spider-monkey hide. The hide is still covered in fine black hairs. The palms of the gloves are made from dark, padded leather that fits snugly to the wearer’s hands.
History: Vita Flavius claimed to have bought these gloves from a merchant, who had in turn bought them from natives in the Corlathian Mountains, who had in turn found them in the lost city of Mattawab. In reality, Vita, a skilled artificer, had crafted the gloves herself. However, it was her passion to discover the lost city, and selling the gloves was her best chance of financing an expedition. Few scholars of note believed her story of the origin of these items, but they were useful enough that she was able to finance her dream. The expedition, and Vita, were never heard from again.
Abilities/Effects: While these gloves are worn you have a climb speed equal to your normal speed. In addition, you can use your reaction when you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times you character level.
Monster Whistles
Wondrous item, rarity varies
Description: These items appear to be small folk charms on leather thongs or slim chains, but closer inspection reveals that they are actually whistles.
History: The four spellcasters that became the Whistling Company first met in the Free City of Blackwand. They wished to become adventurers, but their lack of fighting skill concerned them. They found a solution in the market, where an Undir was 
selling hand-carved whistles shaped like various creatures. Pooling their magical knowledge, the four were able to enchant these whistles into summoning charms, and for years the Whistling Company had many adventures. After the two surviving members retired they sold the whistles, which have become popular in the private garrisons of noble houses for their ability to simultaneously summon help and raise the alarm.
Abilities/Effects: These whistles are small enough to fit in your pocket. You can use an action to blow one of them and cast conjure animals.
The creature or creatures you summon is determined by the specific whistle.
Once used, these whistles regain the ability to summon forth their bound spirits after 7 days have passed.
Azure Lizard, (uncommon):
This bright-blue ocarina is shaped like a lizard. When blown its sharp staccato call summons 8 giant lizards.
Bird of Omens (uncommon):
This short, squat flute is made from mahogany. When blown, it creates a sharp, squawking call that summons 8 swarms of ravens.
Blood Wing (rare): This sinister looking charm is made of blood-red cypress wood with a long, thin proboscis that serves as a mouthpiece. When sounded, it makes a strange, echoing buzzing noise that summons 8 striges.
Glistening Crawlers (uncommon): This wormwood flute is carved with coiling centipedes along its length and is lacquered to a warm color. When blown, it produces a deep, earthy tone which summons 4 swarms of insects.

Iron Eater (rare): This iron-wood penny whistle is carved into the shape of a hump-backed quadruped with a propeller tail and long feelers. When blown, it produces an off-key sound that clashes with itself which summons 4 rust monsters.
Marrow Men (rare): This macabre flute is carved from a human tibia. The bone is stained with dried blood and produces a shallow, haunting tune which summons 8 zombies.
Silken Spinner (uncommon): This intricate and graceful ocarina is made from polished silkwood shaped as a spider. When blown, it resounds with a tinkling whispery tune which summons 2 giant spiders.
 
Necklace of Beroe
Wondrous item, rare
Description: Seven turquoise and aquamarine plates, each engraved with breaking waves, are set into a steel and cobalt alloyed chain. Each link of the chain is shaped like the shell of a sea-creature.
History: Valanos created the first necklace of Beroe in pale imitation of one of the five great elorii artifacts in
Belestor. Many Berokene wore them as signs of devotion, and after the fall of Belestor and the loss of the great artifacts the necklaces continued to be worn in remembrance. The Berotar of Entaris, in particular, prize these necklaces highly.
No necklace has ever been given willingly to outsiders, and most Berokene consider the wearing of these items by humans to be an affront worthy of death.
Abilities/Effects: While worn underwater you can breathe normally as if you were under the effects of a water breathing spell and you gain a +1 bonus to your AC.
Speak with Her Children (Requires Attunement): You can only attune to this item if you are a Berokene elorii. You can communicate with any creature native to lakes, rivers, or oceans as if you were constantly under the effects of a speak with animals spell.
In addition, while in or near a body of water, you can use your action to cast conjure animals, summoning aquatic creatures only. Once you use this ability, you cannot use it again until the next dawn.
Necromantic Shroud
Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)
Description: This funeral shroud is embroidered in barely visible spider silk with hundreds of tiny magical glyphs.
History: Tasia val’Mordane, a Coryani Nerothian, spoke passionately against the Cancerese rebellion. Despite this, she barely escaped from an angry anti-Nerothian mob that burned her home and killed her spouse and daughter. Enraged by this injustice, she made her way north to Canceri, bearing her dead child on her back. The Cancerese were loath to trust such an outspoken opponent of the Dark Triumvirate, so to prove that she had truly turned 
against the Coryani she created the first necromantic shroud from the funeral wrappings of her daughter and personally presented it to the Dark Apostate. Many Cancerese temples of Neroth now have a shroud on hand, though they are considered illegal and heretical by most other nations.
Abilities/Effects: When you place this shroud over a freshly deceased corpse, it rises as a ghoul under your control after 1 minute. You may control up to 5 ghouls at any one time; any additional ghouls created are not under your control. You can control ghouls raised with the shroud as if you created them with create undead but they do not count against any limits for controlling undead with that spell.
The shroud is easily destroyed; it possesses AC 10 and 10 hit points. If destroyed, all ghouls it created are set free from your control.
Needle of Mending
Wondrous item, uncommon
Description: This needle appears to be a simple copper needle with several tiny glyphs etched into it.
History: Found throughout the Coryani Empire, these items are prized by surgeons, soldiers, and tailors everywhere. Originally created by clerics of Beltine for simple household tasks, the secret of their creation has spread, and they are now common household items in the richest sections of all major cities.
Centurions quickly discovered how useful a Needle of Mending could be - from darning socks, to repairing armor or quickly sewing shut a comrade’s wounds. As their reputation spread, so did their abundance. Now many field medics make this item a standard part of their healer’s bag. Every legionnaire that can afford it owns one of these magical needles.
Abilities/Effects: You may
spend 1 minute working with this needle to repair any ripped or torn object made of cloth, leather, or similar substance as if you had cast the mending cantrip.
You may also use the needle while taking a short rest to heal one creature of 2d8 hit points of damage.
Once this ability is used, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.
 
Nier’s Heart
Wondrous item, rare
Description: These pins are made from a fire opal, a gem said to be the eggs of salamanders that glow with an inner fire.
History: Many were surprised when Arthmoor val’Virdan, rather than a more martial Nierite, was selected to be the first Dark Apostate of Canceri. Those who chose him, however, knew that his religious fervor and political acumen were what they needed. Arthmoor’s religious training included divine magic, and in his younger days he had created these pins from fire opals. When he became Dark Apostate he bestowed the items as honors for those who had served Canceri loyally. During their occupation, the Swords of Nier confiscated some of these pins for their own troops, and now the pins are considered awards of honor in both militaries.
Abilities/Effects: While wearing this pin, you have advantage on all saving throws against spells or effects which deal fire damage.
Sword of my Lord (Requires Attunement): You may only attune to this item if you are a worshipper of Nier. While wearing this pin, you can use an action to cast either flame blade or Nier’s blade, regaining the ability to do so daily at
daw ii.
See Chapter Nine for the new spell, Nier’s Blade.
Olymed’s Armband
of Ever-Ready Blades
Wondrous item, rare
Description: This armband is made from twisted strands of gold and engraved with symbols of strength and alertness. This armlet is worn around the bicep and is often kept in full view by proud dwarven warriors. Intricate golden charms hang from the armlet, up to six in total, each a minute yet perfect representation of a weapon.
History: Created by the dwarven weapon master, Olymed, these bracelets are a boon to any warrior caught without a weapon or forced to leave their favorite sword at the tavern door. Olymed, a successful dwarven craftsman from Solanos Mor, became widely known for the quality of his creations sold throughout Marketplace, the large bazar 
situated at the foot of the mountain that houses the Solani enclave.
Abilities/Effects: When worn, as an action you can transform any weapon you hold with a weight of 20 lbs. or less into a small charm which hangs upon this armband. While in this form, any ability that weapon possesses is inactive. Up to 6 weapons may be stored this way, and weapons with ammunition share a slot with their ammunition, such as a bow and a quiver of arrows. You can summon a stored weapon back to your hands as a bonus action, with ammunition appearing either on you or next to you.
If the armband is targeted by a dispel magic spell, all the weapons that are charms instantly appear at your feet. If the armband is ever destroyed, roll a d4 for each weapon. On a 1 that weapon is destroyed. On any other result the weapon appears at your feet.
Orb of Lore
Wondrous item, very rare
Description: This fist-sized sphere of dark blue crystal is highly sought after by scholars and sages.
History: Allathan val’Abebi was a great artificer who helped construct the flying city of Khafre. While others worked on the structure, he crafted artifacts within the city. His crowning achievement was the great orb of lore, a repository of knowledge and prophecy that, so said Allathan, would ensure the Altherians would always be the most advanced people in the world. Like Khafre itself, the orb was a symbol of Altherian hubris, and when the city crashed it shattered in an explosion that slew Allathan. Chastened by this, his apprentices created the modern orbs. Though not nearly as powerful as the original, there are many, ensuring that they will never be lost in a single disaster.
Abilities/Effects: You may use this orb as a spellcasting focus when casting divination spells.
The orb also has 3 charges, and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. If the last charge is ever used the orb cannot regain charges until left undisturbed in a library or museum for 1 day.
While holding the orb, you may use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells: comprehend languages (1 charge), identify (1 charge), legend lore (2 charges).
Orb of Nikenes val’Mehan
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
Description: This small orb, no larger than a pebble, is made from a tiger’s eye gem.
History: In the late ninth century Nurion the Undying briefly reappeared from his wanderings at the Sanctorum of the Arcane in Nishanpur, of all places. He delivered the first known example of the orb, along with detailed notes on its construction. Nurion claimed that he did not invent the orb, but rather he found clues to its creation in the ruins of the tower of Nikenes val’Mehan, a First Imperium mage that, it is said, had dealings with the mysterious being known only as Amanth. Nikenes was constantly trying to push the boundaries of what magic could do, and Nurion suspected that an experiment gone wrong was what ultimately destroyed his tower and killed him.
Abilities/Effects: This orb may be used as an arcane focus. When it is held, you have advantage on all Constitution saving throws made to maintain concentration on your spells.
As a bonus action while concentrating on a spell, you may suspend your concentration for up to 5 rounds, storing the energy of the spell in the orb. As an action, you may resume concentrating on the original spell as if your concentration had not been broken. You must resume concentrating on the spell after 5 rounds of the spell ends. Once the orb is used in this manner you may not utilize it in this way again until dawn the next day.
Orb of Opalescence
Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)
Description: These extremely rare black opals have only been discovered near the Sorcerer Stones in the Hinterlands.
History: Who creates these orbs, or why, is not known. What is known is that the Ehtzara and the Cult of the Jackal do not look kindly upon those who remove them from the Sorcerer Stones. They claim ownership of the orbs and are exceedingly jealous of their property.
Abilities/Effects: You may use this orb as an arcane focus.
The orb also has 3 charges, and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. If the last charge is ever used the orb loses all magical properties until 7 days has passed.
While holding the orb, you may use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells: prismatic spray (1 charge, save DC 16), prismatic wall (1 charge, save DC 18).
Orb of the Hidden Flame
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
Description: These orbs appear to be made of russet- colored granite.
History: The Order of the Hidden Flame had these items developed so they could track the movements of their 
members. Rumors persist that other factions and secret societies maintain their own versions of these items. The existence of such an item is withheld from the common member and if questioned about such an item, its existence is vehemently denied.
Abilities/Effects: Each of these orbs is keyed to a specific group such as a secret society, a military order, a religious faction, or something similar. While holding this orb, you may use an action to cast a modified version of locate creature which only locates members or ex-members of whatever group or secret society orb was created to detect. Additionally, while you are attuned to this orb, you cannot be the target of divination magic used to find your location.
Orb of the Seer
Wondrous item, uncommon
Description: This large crystal orb appears to have been carved with wild, twisted glyphs that glow with their own inner radiance.
History: The first orb of the seer was created by Ahrizan, a celestial giant of the Tultipet clan. After crafting this orb, he saw a vision of the future, including the horrible fate of the celestial giants. He begged his clan leader to abandon their tyrannical rule over humans, and for his troubles he was declared a traitor and slain. After the curse was laid upon the dwarves, the Tultipetans remembered Ahrizan, and began to revere him as a prophet and saint. In penance, they crafted many more of the orbs and gave them to the Temple of Larissa, where these orbs are primarily found to this day.
 
Abilities/Effects: You may use this orb as a spellcasting focus while casting any divination spell. While holding this orb, you may spend 1 minute to receive a glimpse into the future. This glimpse comes as a flood of pictures, sounds, and emotions. You may attempt a DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check to determine the general emotion invoked by the visions, such as fear, disgust, anguish, distrust, or pleasure. Also, at the GM’s discretion, you may perform a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check to recall specific details of the vision.
If you are a val’Sheem, you gain advantage on your Wisdom (Insight) and Intelligence (Investigation) checks when attempting to discern your visions.
Orb of Vision
Wondrous item, rare or very rare (requires attunement)
Description: This small smooth quartz has an impurity in the center that makes it look like an eyeball.
History: Jana Gavius, Inquisitor of the Mother Church assigned to Tralia, had settled into her assigned province well, marrying and bearing two children. Then a Cancerese heretic slipped into her village and spread the deadly disease known as infant’s sleep. Jana caught the heretic soon after, but he laughed in her face. His wicked deed was done, and Jana’s children were among the slain. Jana blamed herself for not discovering him sooner and left her husband to fight in the first Heretic War. To ensure she would never again be caught unawares, she plucked out her own eye and crafted the first orb of vision to replace it. It has since become a symbol of the most fanatical of the Church’s inquisitors.

Additionally, this eye has 3 charges which may be used for the following abilities. The orb of vision regains ld3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you use the item’s last charge, roll a d20.

Pacorus’ Gauntlet
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)
Description: This iron gauntlet is fearsome to behold. Its fingertips are sharpened like talons, while the knuckles, reinforced and ridged, have a different gem affixed above each one. The outer portion of the gauntlet is silver plated, with black chainmail lies underneath.
History: Pacorus the Terrible was the most notorious of the Priest-Kings of the Auxunite Empire. It is said there was a hunger inside him, a hunger to spread fear among his subjects. At first these dark ambitions were tempered by his fellow priest-kings, but then Pacorus retreated into his lair for a year and a day, forging his gauntlet of power. When he emerged, the bejeweled gauntlet glittering on his right hand, he could no longer be opposed. The priest- kings who sought to stop him found themselves cowering before him, their bodies wracked with disease and mad cackles mixing with sobs in their throats.
For ten years Pacorus spread terror and fear throughout the empire, until he was finally felled by an assassin, much to the people’s relief.
 
Abilities/Effect: This gauntlet is a magic weapon makes your unarmed strikes deal magical slashing or bludgeoning damage. The gauntlet possesses 5 charges and regains 1d4+1 expended charges daily at midnight. If you use the final charge roll a d20.

Wondrous item, common
Description: This is a collection of marble-sized prayer beads made of semi-precious stones, looped onto a string of animal gut. These beads are worn as either a necklace or as a wristlet.
History: The Pengik people place great stock in their oral history, which is maintained and passed on from generation to generation by their tribal shamans. Some shamans are better at recalling information than others, and those who have difficultly are typically presented with these memory beads.
Abilities/Effects: Once you have worn these beads openly for 1 day you have advantage on all Intelligence (History) checks and all Intelligence checks to remember things you have seen or heard. 
Phantom Steed Saddle
Wondrous item, rare
Description: This finely worked riding saddle comes complete with saddlebags and is trimmed with rare ermine furs.
History: This saddle is rumored to have been created for a pompous and fastidious Altherian noble who found the smell of horses offensive and the thought of tending to such a beast beneath his station.
Abilities/Effects: You can use your action to command this saddle to create a semi-real light riding horse beneath it, exactly as the phantom steed spell. The saddle only functions in this way for 12 hours each day, but that duration can be divided into 1 hour segments.
Pin of Illiir’s Radiance
Wondrous item, uncommon
Description: This pin is crafted in the shape of the sun with beams of light encircling it.
History: After the Cult of the Thousand-Eyed Man massacred the populace of the city of Kofan, the fledgling Inquisition realized that it needed new strength. Before the Patriarch went into hiding he charged the priesthoods with developing more powerful magical items. The temple of Illiir answered the call with this pin, which is still prized by inquisitors in the Mother Church and Milandisian Orthodoxy. The one rule laid upon inquisitors is that these pins are only to be worn when heresy is suspected in the field, for under the pin’s power even the smallest of lies told for the sake of social niceties become difficult, and wearing one in a social setting is a serious faux pas.
Abilities/Effects: While this pin is worn openly, any creature that attempts to he to you must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed saving throw, that creature must tell you the truth for 1 minute. Upon a successful saving throw they become immune to the pin’s effects until the next dawn.
 
An affected creature is aware of the pin’s effect and can thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a he. Such a creature can be evasive in its answers as long as it remains within the boundaries of the truth.
Pin of
Neroth’s Blessing
Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a worshiper ofNeroth)
Description: This pin, shaped like an ankh, the holy symbol ofNeroth, and grants Neroth’s blessing to the wearer.
History: Many of the Nerothian necropolises of southern Canceri have areas warded against all but the undead, making them all but impenetrable fortresses of the val’Mordane family. During the Heretic Wars Radegond Nordohter, a Milandisian, created five of these pins; one for herself and the others for her four companions, whom she led in a daring raid on one of the larger necropolises. She succeeded in her mission of collapsing the necropolis at the cost of her life, foiling a Cancerese push south. Her pin was found by her enemies, and later copies are now primarily found in southern Canceri. Unlike the original, however, these copies crumble to dust after removal.
Abilities/Effects: When this pin is worn openly, you are considered to be undead. You gain immunity to poison damage and the poisoned condition, resistance to necrotic damage, and resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, slashing and piercing damage from weapons that aren’t silvered. You do not need to eat, sleep, or even breathe.
Curse: Once attuned to this item you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw to remove this pin. On a failed saving throw, you suffer 4 levels of exhaustion. On a successful saving throw, you suffer 2 levels of exhaustion. Once removed, the pin crumbles to dust.
Pin of Sarish’s Might
Wondrous item, rare
(requires attunement by a worshiper ofSarish) 
Description: This pin is purple disk with inscribed sigils of Sarish and it protects the wearer from the touch of infernals.
History: Legend has it that these pins were created by brave Sarishans who supported the First Emperor’s crusade against the infernal menace. These legends are false. In actuality these pins were created by Khurshid val’Mehan, a still-living traveling merchant, so that she could charge a higher price. Despite her duplicity, the pins still work as advertised and are frequently found among the brave crusaders at the Wall of the Gods, as well as among the Sarishans of the Dark Triumvirate.
Abilities/Effects: When openly worn, any infernal that targets you with an attack or harmful spell must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or choose a new target for their attack or spell. An infernal that fails their saving throw is unable to directly harm or touch you for 1 minute. This effect does not protect you from area effects attacks, such as the fireball spell.
Pipe of the Underworld
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
Description: This ivory pipe is capped at either end with grimy bronze fittings. When smoking from this pipe, the grey smoke tendrils form macabre shapes of menacing spirits.
History: Even before the Becherek Heresy, the Nerothians of Canceri preferred to work with undead rather than destroy them. Pratibha Lai created the first pipe of the underworld in the seventh century, giving it in secret to the temple of Neroth. With these pipes the temple was able to enchant and sway rogue undead to return to their necropolises, sparing them from destruction by the Mother Church. She was not given the gift of Neroth, though she did live long enough to see Canceri become an independent nation. After the insurrection, the Nerothians removed the veil of secrecy from her creation, and it can now be found throughout southern Canceri, and rarely in other nations.
Abilities/Effects: These pipes may be used as an arcane or divine focus if you are a follower of Cadic or Neroth.
When you are holding these pipes, any undead you target with enchantment spells suffer
disadvantage on their saving throws to resist the effects. If an undead affected by one of your spells succeeds on their saving throw they are immune to the pipe of the underworld until the next midnight.
 
Pipes of the Madcap Minstrel
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster with proficiency with wind instruments)
Description: This pair of silver flutes is inscribed with a peculiar spiral design around their length. These flutes are tuned to different pitches so that they harmonize with each other.
History: Bedlas the Twisted, heretical bard of Erhan, created these paired flutes to help rouse the peasantry into open rebellion against the local temple of Illiir. The rebellion died before it could start, primarily because the Inquisition of the Mother Church dispatched the Legio Lex Talionis to capture and execute Bedlas for heresy.
Abilities/Effects: These pipes have 10 charges and regain 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the pipes’ last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, these pipes lose their magical properties until you cast 10 spell levels worth of enchantment spells into the pipes, at which point the pipes regain 1 charge and continues to regain charges as normal.
While holding the pipes, you can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells, using your spell save DC: confusion (4 charges), enthrall (2 charges), and mass suggestion (6 charges).
Plume of
Righteous Victory
Wondrous item, very rare
Description: This item is a brightly colored plume fashioned from the tail of the rare kuni bird.
History: Since the death of Menesis val’Thnsen and the founding of the Free States of Almeric, the Sons of Righteous Fury have dedicated themselves to uniting Almeric, and thus the val’Tensen family. They have not forgotten their goal of seeing a val’Thnsen on the Alabaster Throne, but they recognize the unification of Almeric as a necessary first step. To this end, they have crafted plumes of righteous victory for their allies. The plumes are deliberately crafted in the Ulfilan and Milandisian style, eschewing the typical Coryani crest, as a symbol of the change they seek to bring to Onara.
Abilities/Effects: While wearing a helm or hat with this plume attached, as a bonus action you can cast either righteous fury or smite infidel (save DC 13). Once either one of these spells are cast from the plume it may not cast that spell again until the next dawn.

Pomanders can also be found scattered about the homes of the affluent, transforming them into a pleasing and relaxing retreat from the squalor and most importantly smell of city life.
Abilities/Effects: This pomander can be attuned to any room no larger than 50 square feet. Once attuned, a creature touching the pomander may use an action to grant all creatures within the area resistance against poison damage and advantage on all saving throws to resist disease or the poisoned condition for 1 hour.

Pot of Simmering
Wondrous item, uncommon
Description: Common among nobility serving their time in the legions, these small cast iron bowls are etched with permanently inscribed runes of fire, and thought not powerful enough to create a campfire these useful bowls can be used to cook food and keep drinks warm on the coldest of nights. Interestingly these bowls have an additional use; they can burn away the poison from tainted food.
History: Emperor Quintelus val’Dellenov’s third son Efrem never wanted to be a legionnaire; he wanted to be a scholar and artificer. However, his father was insistent that no son of his would “spend his days locked up in a library like an Altherian", and forced him into the Legion of the Mighty Oak. Efrem despised the rough life of a legionnaire, and used his skill with artificing to create the pot of simmering so he could at least get a hot meal on cold nights, and ensure the moldy rations did not kill him. Sadly, his magic pot could not stop enemy arrows, but after his death his fellow legionnaires sold his creation at a profit. Pots of simmering are now marketed to noble households throughout Onara.
Abilities/Effects: As an action you may put food or drink in this pot and have it heat up as if it were under the effects of a heat metal spell. The bowl’s exterior remains cool to the touch while any food inside stays warm. This effect lasts until all the food within is eaten.
Purify my Meal (Requires Attunement): You may have the bowl cast purify food and drink on the food or drink within it.
Raiment of Illiir
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
Description: These pure white garments are trimmed with ermine and gold-cloth, with a golden sunburst emblazoned upon the chest.
History: Dating from the Imperium, these vestments have always been worn by the high priests of Illiir while enacting their sacred rituals. Most of these ancient vestments have been stolen, lost through the ages, and the priests of Illiir are always seeking their return. Agents of the Silence vie with them on this search, but with the goal of desecrating and destroying these holy apparels.
Abilities/Effects: While wearing this cloak you gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class and all saving throws. Additionally, you have advantage on saving throws against spells cast by divine spellcasters who do not worship Illiir.
Red Howler Mask
Wondrous item, rare
Description: This is a large ironwood mask painted blood red and carved in the image of a bestial creature with ivory tusks, distended lupine ears, and a shaggy mane of hair. When this mask is donned, it animates into a snarling visage of horror.
History: The first of these items to be studied by humans came to the Free City of Blackwand three years before the outbreak of the Coryani Civil War. Laghyphe of Pajharo, a Kio adventurer, had discovered the item in an abandoned Gar Dolem camp in the wilderness of Uggur. The mask finally laid to rest the long-standing legend that the infamous Red Howler tribe were lycanthropes who could transform themselves into wolves. Now it is believed that their fiercest warriors simply don these masks and take on bestial visages, though that is hardly less terrifying for their opponents.
Abilities/Effects: While this mask is worn you possesses darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, your range is increased by 60 feet. In addition, you can bite as an unarmed strike, dealing 1d6 piercing damage.

Robe of Shadowshaping
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
Description: This thick, black velvet robe cloaks its wearer in darkness. Under bright sunlight, the robe seems to shimmer somewhat and faint magical glyphs can be seen tracing over the surface. The lining of the robe seems to be pure shadow, and is always chilled to the touch.
History: It is a sad truth that the infernal taint of the dark-kin often finds expression in acts of evil. For Mendion the Forktongue, a ninth century bard of little renown, this darkness instead found expression in somewhat self-indulgent and depressing poetry, devotion to Cadic, and fascination with the Shadow Realm. Although his tormented verse never became popular, he created the robe of Shadowshaping, which gained great renown among other followers of the Dark God. The Mother Church tried to commission Mendion as a scholar and artificer, but his heart was in his poetry, and he died penniless in Plexus.
 
illumination for 24 continuous hours, after which it regains 1 charge.

See Chapter Nine for the new spell, Shadow Step. 
throw. On a failed saving throw that creature cannot speak a deliberate lie as long as the rope restrains them,
Once used to restrain a creature, the rope cannot be used again until dawn. The rope has AC 20 and 20 hit points. It regains 1 hit point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If the rope drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed.
Rope of Security
Wondrous item, uncommon
Description: This item appears to be a length of simple, hemp rope.
History: The Hinterlands is far from safe, but there are those who must still make their way across these troubled lands. Kiul, an ascetic, suffered numerous attacks by bandits and vicious beasts as he trekked through this dangerous area. After an attack that left him gravely wounded, he was nursed back to health by a wandering Ehtzara. Taking pity on the traveler, the mystic invoked the blessings of the spirits and enchanted a piece of rope to grant travelers a safe-haven. As word of this device spread throughout the Known Lands, there was a great demand for it and eventually the Ehtzara traded these enchanted ropes to the various Yhing hir tribes, who in turn sold them to others for various favors and boons.
Abilities/Effects: This rope is 60 feet long and weighs 5 pounds. If you hold one end of the rope and use an action to speak its command word, the rope surrounds a 20-foot radius area, erecting a ward that protects the area from unwanted intrusion. For the next 8 hours, this ward alerts you whenever a Tiny or larger creature touches or enters the warded area. When you set the rope, you may designate creatures that won’t set off the ward. You also choose whether the ward’s alert is mental or audible.
A mental alarm alerts you with a ping in your mind if you are within 1 mile of the warded area. This ping awakens you if you are sleeping. An audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell for 10 seconds within 60 feet.
Once used, the rope cannot be used again until the next dawn.
Saddle of Mount Mastery
Wondrous item, uncommon
Description: This Khur Gi style saddle is plain and functional, designed for form over function by this taciturn people.
History: This saddle was first created by a Khur Gi shaman who sought to prove that his power was greater than that of the Ehtzara. To do this, he declared that he would tame a dire bat that had been terrorizing the area for years and that the Ehtzara had been unable to banish. After stalking the beast for weeks, he and a group of warriors were able to capture the creature long enough to place the saddle upon it. Miraculously, the beast became docile enough to be flown back to the heart of the Khur Gi encampment, where the shaman basked in the glory showered upon him by the tribe. Sadly, the shaman was found days later, ripped apart like an overripe fruit. The enchanted saddle that had won him such acclaim had been tossed to one side and the dire bat was gone. Wisely, the Khur Gi chieftain declared that the saddle would be used solely on natural creatures and that creatures within the supernatural realm would be best left to the Ehtzara.
Abilities/Effects: This saddle may be worn by any Medium or Large mount. When this saddle is first put on a creature, they must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become docile and well-behaved. While the mount is docile, its rider gains advantage on any Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks that relate to the mount. Each day at dawn, the mount can make a new saving throw. If the mount succeeds or if the saddle is left off the mount for more than 1 hour, the mount is free of the enchantment until the next dawn.
Saddle of Security
Wondrous item, very rare
Description: This monogrammed saddle appears as a normal, albeit highly-decorated, military saddle.
History: Created by the Pearl Maidens to protect members of their monastic order from the many predators that roam the Hinterlands, this item tends to capture more of the two¬legged variety than the four-legged ones. Either way, the vermin are dealt with quickly and without mercy.
Abilities/Effects: This saddle can be worn by both Medium and Large sized mounts. It is enchanted with a permanent arcanist’s magic aura spell, giving it a false aura to appear nonmagical.
As an action, you can command this saddle to cast the alarm spell that only affects the mount wearing it. If any creature but yourself attempts to ride the mount, the spell alerts you with an audible alarm. In addition, the saddle will cast hold person (DC 12 saving throw, no concentration needed) on whatever creature triggered the alarm. When you activate this effect, you can designate creatures that won’t set off the alarm. Once you use the saddle in this way, you cannot do so again until the next dawn.
Saraph’s Spanning Rug
Wondrous item, rare
Description: This is a 5 ft. by 10 ft. wool carpet with geometrical patterns woven in blue and black upon its surface. 
History: The ancient Auxunite Empire was an exotic land, filled with wondrous and bizarre magical artifacts. After their expulsion from the area south of the Gods’ Wall, a few of these relics were left behind and are still found by intrepid explorers and treasure hunters.
In a cache beneath a dangerously tilted stone tower in the Duchy of Tralia, dozens of wool rugs were discovered, miraculously preserved as if they were weaved just the other day.
Abilities/Effects: As an action you may command the rug to grow to four times its original size (20 ft. by 40 ft.) and become rigid. The rug does not attach itself to surfaces but it is strong enough to bridge gaps. While expanded, the rug can support up to 600 lbs., exceeding this maximum causes it to tear and break, dropping everything it was supporting. As an action, you may command the rug to quickly return into its original form, rolling up at your feet.
Sarishan Seal
Wondrous item, uncommon
Description: These large stamps are forged from Sarishan steel and have a long handle. On the underside of the seal is a series of arcane symbols surrounding the holy symbol of Sarish.
History: These seals are forged by Sarishan priests to seal contracts between parties, be they merchants, rulers or infernals. All signatories to the contract know that breaking the letter of the agreement carries with it dire consequences, which includes divine retribution. Those who swear by Lord Sarish’s name do not do so lightly.
Abilities/Effects: Worshippers of Sarish may use this seal as an arcane focus. If held while casting the Sarishan oath spell, this seal forms a magical connection between itself and the oath. A Sarishan seal be linked to a maximum of 3 independent oaths. When holding the seal, you can mentally review the oaths it is currently linked to and disconnect the seal from any or all of those oaths.
If any party breaks one of the oaths a Sarishan seal is linked to, all involved parties are instantly aware of it. Additionally, while holding the seal, those cursed with the Curse of the Oathbreaker suffer disadvantage on all saving throws against any divination spell cast by you.
See Chapter Nine for the new spell, Sarishan oath.
 
Sash of Keleos
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
Description: Four rhinestones are set into red¬gold plates that are attached to this sash. The sash itself is made from fiery-red silk threads, interwoven with fine gold strands.
History: This item, and others of its kind, is part of a set of ancient eloran artifacts connected to the Elemental Lords. Though Keleos has not answered any prayers directed to him in centuries, items blessed by him, such as this sash, are revered by the elorii as a lasting link to their devoured god. Elorii do not look kindly upon humans wearing these belts, and actively hunt any val believed to be possessing one.

You also gain the ability to cast produce flame, using Charisma as your spellcasting ability.
Scabbard of the Blessed
Wondrous item, uncommon
Description: This plain scabbard bears the holy symbol of the deity it is dedicated to embossed on its side.
History: Divine artificers of the Imperium of Man sought to create ever more opulent items of power. With great pride they would bring their jewel-encrusted, gold-wrought trinkets to the Temple of the Pantheon, more for their own glory than for the glory of the gods. Then one day Akantha val’Inares presented twelve simple scabbards, each unadorned save for an embroidered symbol of one of the gods of the Pantheon of Man. Some reacted with scorn, and others with fury at such a plain offering, but Eunike val’Virdan stepped forward, sheathed her sword within the scabbard of Nier, and drew it forth again. The sword glowed with divine power, and Eunike boldly declared that Akantha had put all the pride of the priests to shame, for with her simple gift she had enhanced the strength of the armies of humanity. Since that time none have tried to embellish these scabbards, for their plainness is a reminder that the gods favor substance over appearance. 
Abilities/Effects: If you are a worshipper of the same god that the scabbard is dedicated to you may use a bonus action to bless your blade as you draw it from the scabbard. A non-magical sword blessed in this way becomes a magic weapon and grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls for the next hour. Once used, you cannot use this ability again until the next dawn.
Simple Gifts (Requires Attunement): You may only attune to the scabbard if you are a divine spellcaster dedicated to the same god as the scabbard. While wearing the scabbard, you may cast smite heretic, using Wisdom as your spellcasting ability. Once used, you cannot use this ability again until the next dawn.
See Chapter Nine for the new spell smite heretic.
Scabbard of the Elements
Wondrous item, uncommon
Description: These finely tooled wood and leather scabbards are always etched with patterns depicting one of the four elements: mountains for earth, rivers for water, flames for fire, and clouds for air.
History: Perinia the Berokene,
Vatatos the Kelekene, Terethes the Marokene, and Avarea the Osalikene were renowned in Belestor as the finest artisans of their bloodlines.
Being friendly rivals, they organized : competition between them to each design a beautiful, yet functional, scabbard.
Soon their contest became something else entirely, as the four masters pushed, critiqued, and advised each other to greater heights of skill. Crowds gathered. All sensed that something marvelous was in the making.
And then the Elemental Lords, in all their glory, appeared before them. They declared the work a symbol of the strength of the bloodlines when they worked together, and they imbued not only the originals, but all future scabbards made in the same manner with a breath of their power. Even today some few artisans still toil endlessly to recreate the original masterworks.
Abilities/Effects: Each of these scabbards is attuned to an element: earth, air, fire, or water. Any time you draw a non-magical blade from one of these scabbards, as a bonus action you may infuse it with elemental power. This makes the sword a magic weapon that grants you a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls and deals an additional 1d4 damage of the appropriate elemental type (acid for earth, cold for water, thunder for air, fire for fire) for the next hour. Once used this ability cannot be used again until the next dawn.
 
Strength of the Bloodlines (Requires Attunement): You
can only become attuned to one of these scabbards if you are an elorii whose bloodline matches the element of the scabbard.

This makes the sword a magic weapon that grants you a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls and deals an additional 1d6 damage of the appropriate elemental type (acid for earth, cold for water, thunder for air, fire for fire) for the next hour. You may use this item a number of times equal to your Blood Rank, regaining all expended uses daily at dawn.
Scarab of the Bronze Catacombs
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
Description: These scarabs appear as small, stylized beetles
crafted from bronze and set with small fragments of jet and black opals.
History: These insidious scarabs were invented by the twisted mind of one of the ancient Necromancer Lords ofMyrantis, Lord Neferka Siptah. Lord Siptah was an adherent of the god Tzizhet, the Many Limbed, making frequent sacrifices to this abomination. He created these scarabs as a means of sending sacrifices to Tzizhet’s home, a never-ending labyrinth of twisting bronze tunnels, all leading invariably to his deity’s lair.
Abilities/Effects: While this scarab is held, as an action you may throw it at creature and cast maze on that target. Once the spell ends, the scarab returns to you and cannot be used again until the next dawn.
Sentinel Necklace
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
Description: This simple choker is made from twisted rose-thorns. The barbs of the thorns stick and jab the wearer’s neck, keeping them awake. The longer you wear 
this necklace, the more unhinged you become due to lack
o| sleep.
History: The Temple of Larissa keeps the origin of these necklaces a secret, for they were created by the infamous Iduma val’Sheem, better known for defecting to and later leading the cult of the Lady of Thorns. While these necklaces are simply too useful to many adventurers and to the Coryani legions to declare them heretical, the Larissans fear the backlash should the truth of their creation be known. Meanwhile Iduma made many of these necklaces for the cult after his defection, the cult now uses them as part of their recruitment techniques, driving initiates mad from lack of sleep and then brainwashing them.
Abilities/Effects: While worn, you cannot fall asleep under any means and are immune to any effect that would cause you to fall asleep. You do not gain any levels of exhaustion from this lack of sleep.
If you wear this necklace for more than 3 days, you have disadvantage on all Intelligence and Wisdom checks. If you wear this necklace for 4 days, you have disadvantage on all Intelligence and Wisdom saving throws. If you wear this necklace for 5 days or more, you suffer from indefinite madness.
Serpent Boots
Wondrous item, uncommon or rare
Description: These knee-boots are made from the hide of a giant constrictor snake and shod at the heel and toe with copper. The toe is ornamented to appear as a viper’s mouth.
History: Ownership of these boots is considered a badge of honor for those serving in the Shining Patrol. Seeing a pair on a patrolman means that they engaged and killed a ssanu during their tour of duty. The hide of the ssanu is then taken to an Altherian mage-artificer, who uses it to create a pair of serpent boots. Since the members of the Shining Patrol come from all over the continent, these boots can be found across Onara, usually on the feet of retired members of the Patrol.
Abilities/Effects: While worn you may use a bonus action to disguise your tracks as the tracks of a snake for up to 1 hour. This hour does not need to be continuous, and may be deactivated as a bonus action. Once this these boots have been used for an hour, the magic in these boots cease to function until you have completed a long rest.
The rare version of these boots also grant advantage on saving throws to resist poison damage or the poisoned condition.
Shawl of Starry Witchcraft
Wondrous item, uncommon
Description: These shawls are made of black wool and sewn with small crystals that glitter and shimmer in the hght.
History: The first of these shawls was created in the region that eventually became Salantis, and used fish scales instead of crystals to create the shimmering effects. Egica, the shawl’s creator, led his people in worshiping an unnamed god of sea and stars. For some time, his magical power allowed his people to flourish, but as he grew older his mind sank into madness. Eventually his own people turned on him, slaying him and delivering his shawl to the priests of the gods of the Pantheon of Man. It is rarely used by trained mages, but hedge mages and other isolated spellcasters often favor its power.
Abilities/Effects: While wearing this shawl, you can use it as a spellcasting focus which grants you a +1 bonus on spell attack rolls
Shroud of the Initiate
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
Description: This hood, used during certain ceremonies, is made from black cloth that covers the head and face. A fine gold mesh covers the eyes, but still allows one to see clearly. Upon the forehead is a stylized eye embroidered with gold thread.
History: This rare item is one of a handful that has some sort of eye motif emblazoned upon it. The eye has nothing to do with the ability of the item, nor is it a crafter’s mark, leading many to be perplexed by its prominent placement. Among val’Abebi scholars, there is a heated debate as to whether an as yet unknown group or organization was, or still is, secretly manipulating the nations and people of the Known Lands. Taken separately, these relics may point to nothing, but other eye symbols found in strange doorways and ancient passages, as well as complete passages excised from tomes with clear precision, cause some to wonder.
Abilities/Effects: While worn you cannot be the target of a divination spell or perceived by magical scrying sensors.
As an action, you can use the hood to change the color of your skin, hair and clothing, granting you advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide or Charisma (Deception) checks to disguise yourself for up to 1 minute. After using this ability, you cannot use it again until you complete a short rest. 
Skeleton Key
Wondrous item, uncommon
Description: A Skeleton Key appears to be a sturdy steel key three inches in length. It has many strange and twisted prongs jutting from the shaft at weird angles and the head of the key is carved to look like a grinning human skull.
History: Hundreds of these items have been found throughout Onara but they all owe their origin to the devious and crafty mind of Dellius val’Borda. A rogue and a liar,
Dellius hailed from the city of Plexus. He plied his trade as a seedy merchant, sailing the waters of the Corvis River looking for salvageable cargo.
It is rumored that not all of the ships Dellius and his crew salvaged had sunk before he got there. He had a knack of stumbling across the worst wrecks as there were never any survivors.
Dellius had a minor mage as a crewman and it was this unnamed cutthroat who enchanted the first skeleton key.
Dellius convinced his crewmate to craft such an item so they could safely and quickly open the many locked chests and boxed recovered from their salvage operations.	SKELETON K
Abilities/Effects: You may use the
skeleton key to unlock any non-magical lock. While the key is in a lock, as an action you may cast knock on the locked object. Once you use this ability, you cannot do so again until the next dawn.
Sphere of Dark Heritage
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
Description: This is a perfect sphere of black glass approximately 3” in diameter. Staring into its depths reveals an orb of absolute darkness with thousands of tiny silver flecks stirring and swirling through it. The sphere is extremely heavy for its size and is comparable to holding a piece of lead of the same volume.
History: Developed by the formidable secret society known as the Brotherhood of Man, these fervent supremacists feel that the dilution of the human blood line, as exemplified by the dark kin, gnomes and vals, need to be purged so that humanity can remain pure and untainted. To this end, this sphere was created to track down and identify disguised dark kin and prune that branch of humanity’s family tree.
Abilities/Effects: This sphere may be used as an arcane focus. Whenever you can a divination spell using this 
sphere as a focus, creatures with who possesses infernal blood, such as dark-kin, suffer disadvantage on their saving throw to resist your spell.
While touching the sphere, you can cast scrying (save DC 17), using the sphere as the material component. Once used, you cannot use this ability again until the next dawn.
Spiderhook
Wondrous item, uncommon
Description: A spiderhook looks like a normal iron grapnel with four tines. The tines meet and form a single shaft topped with a ring for rope attachment. The ring itself is the only adornment on the entire hook, which is crafted to resemble a large spider perched on the very apex of the shaft with its legs forming the ring.
History: This simple, but useful, item has been duplicated the world over. Believed to have been developed by enterprising rogues, the spiderhook can be found for sale on the black market in most major cities. Interestingly, this item is also utilized by the armies of most nations and issued to scouts patrolling areas with steep or rugged terrain.
Abilities/Effects: You may tie any
rope to this hook’s ring. While holding the hook, you may use an action to command the spiderhook to climb up any surface like a spider, at a speed of 40 feet, and wedge itself in place to serve as a secure anchor for the rope. It will remain in place until ordered to release as a bonus action. A spiderhook can carry up to 120 feet of rope and once wedged in place it can support up to 500 lbs.
Standards of Glory
Wondrous item, legendary
These standards were created by the adroit sorcerers and priests to lead the legions of the Imperium of Man to victory. Since the fall of that empire of antiquity, many have attempted to duplicate their abilities, but have failed. Due to their almost indestructible nature, the standards are found buried beneath battlefields, in tombs and the various ruins that dot the continent. All legion standards are 10-foot tall poles with a horizontal crossbar where the standard is suspended. 
 

 

These standards are held in such esteem, that, almost since the founding of the Coryani Empire, anyone who discovers one and assembles one thousand men may present themselves at the gates of Grand Coryan and be declared a legion of the empire.
Abilities/Effects: In addition to a standard’s specific abilities, described below, all standards of glory have the following abilities:
Born Leader: While carrying the standard, you have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks.
If you are a spellcaster, while carrying the standard your spellcasting ability is considered to be 25. If your spellcasting ability is already 25 or higher, this ability has no effect.
Lines of Communication: While carrying the standard, you can cast message.
Destroying a Standard: Standards of glory are powerful magical items that can withstand the passage of time with little signs of wear. The only way to destroy a standard is to effect it with a spell or ability that causes complete annihilation, such as disintegrate.
The Dolphin Banner of Naeraanth
Description: This banner has a blue field and is emblazoned with three golden dolphins.
History: Though this banner was once the standard for a Yarricite legion, its names and accomplishments are lost and unrecorded. The standard was washed ashore near the city of Naeraanth after an underwater tremor caused a small tidal wave that flooded the area. It was given to Prince Dolfgar val’Ossan of Naeraanth, founder of the Milandisian League, who believed that no army could be defeated while in possession of the standard. History proved that conceit true, though many doubt that the banner was the reason for his military successes.
After the interregnum, the val’Ossan kings of Milandir created an elite force of knights sworn directly to the preservation of val’Ossan line. The banner was placed in the care of these noble men, who, due to its emblems, became known as the Dolphin Guard.
Abilities/Effects: In addition to the abilities of all standards, while carrying this standard you may use an action to cast heroism (using Wisdom as your spellcasting ability), protection from poison, or shield of faith. When cast using the standard, each of these spells is altered so that they can affect up to 1,000 people within 2,000 feet and last for 8 hours.
You do not need to maintain concentration on these spells. If you drop the standard or are killed, any spells cast using the standard end immediately. Once you use the standard to cast one of these spells, you may not use it to cast that spell again until the next dawn.
 
The Standard of the Legion of the Black Sun
Description: This banner originally was white in color, but after the execution of Lothurus Metados val’Virdan it blackened, becoming scorched with the legion’s crest, a blood-red sun enclosed in a black circle. The banner itself smolders, smoking slightly.
History: From records uncovered by the Followers of the Azure Way, the Legion of the Black Sun was the most feared legion of the Imperium, due perhaps to its taking of the gods Nier and Neroth as its patron deities. Fragments 
of scrolls tell of their heroism during the War of the Three Empires, but beyond that, very little is known of this legion.
Millennia later, the Black Sun standard was rediscovered by a former legionnaire, but due to a rebellion led by Nierites, Sarishans and Nerothians, the emperor disbanded the assembled men and burned the hapless discoverer of the standard alive. The two gods were displeased by the disrespect shown by the emperor and raised the moldering corpses of the original legionnaires of the Black Sun. These events so shocked the emperor, that he ordered the standard be locked deep within the vaults beneath the imperial palace.
Abilities/Effects: While carrying this standard, when a living humanoid dies within 60 feet of you, you may use a reaction to animate it as a skeleton under your control. These skeletons remain within 30 feet of you and defend you and the standard. You may only animate a number of skeletons equal to double your proficiency bonus.
Additionally, you may use an action to protect all undead within 1,000 feet, granting them advantage on saving throws against the Channel Divinity:
Turn Undead feature for the next 8 hours. Once this ability is used, it cannot be used again until the next midnight.
 
Coryani power and influence. This act precipitated the first Khitani-Coryani War. The standard of the Legion of the Crimson Moon was last seen at the Battle of the Gate, when the Khitani nearly took the First City. In the passes leading up to the gates, the valiant legionnaires held against the tides of Khitani invaders.
After days of unending battle, General Idan val’Borda, the last
commander of the legion, had little hope for reinforcements. He handed the standard to a young herald, and while calling out For Duty and Honor he personally led the charge against the Khitani. The weakened Khitani forces were routed, but the legion was destroyed. Curiously, the young herald disappeared without a trace during the ensuing battle; the standard he carried is still missing to this day.
Abilities/Effects: In addition to the abilities of all standards, while carrying this standard you may use an action to cast bless, protection from poison, or shield of faith. When cast using the standard, each of these spells is altered so that they can affect up to 1,000 people within 2,000 feet and last for 8 hours.
You do not need to maintain concentration on these spells. If you drop the standard or are killed, any spells cast using the standard end immediately. Once you use the standard to cast one of these spells, you may not use it to cast that spell again until the next dawn.
The Standard of Legio Lex Talionis
Description: This standard depicts a pair of crossed gladius behind a sunburst on a white field. The words Ultioneus Illiir are emblazoned beneath in gold letters, which translates to The Vengeance of Illiir.
History: Hailed as one of the more prestigious legions during the age of the Imperium, the Legio Lex Talionis was one of the first dozen legions reconstituted under the First Emperor, just prior to the founding of the Coryani Empire. Always a pious Illiirite legion, in the modern era, it became so orthodox in its interpretation of scripture that it eventually became the military arm of the Inquisition, hunting heretical cults and infernal worshippers.
The standard is only brought from its place of honor during times of war and crisis. The last time this occurred was during the Coryani Civil War, where the legion participated in several grueling engagements, such as the battles of Enpebyn, Savona and during the invasion of the dwarven enclave of Solanos Mor. 
Abilities/Effects: In addition to the abilities of all standards, while carrying this standard you may use an action to cast bless, longstrider, or protection from energy. When cast using the standard, each of these spells is altered so that they can affect up to 1,000 people within 2,000 feet and last for 8 hours.
You do not need to maintain concentration on these spells. If you drop the standard or are killed, any spells cast using the standard end immediately. Once you use the standard to cast one of these spells, you may not use it to cast that spell again until the next dawn.
Starfire Pendant of Nol Dappa
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
Description: Starfire pendants are crafted with intricate silver chains of braided links from star iron, with a single mounted moonstone.
History: In a region in the Hinterlands known as the Plains of Falling Stars, stars fall from the heavens and crash onto this world more frequently than anywhere else in the Known Lands. Pieces of star iron can be found here in relative abundance, where they are collected by the native tribesmen. With these slivers of star iron, the dwarven craftsmen of Nol Dappa create starfire pendants. Forged in the deepest volcanic fissures beneath the city of Erduk, the pendants absorb the very heat around them.
Each pendant is enchanted by a dwarven priest of Nier and provides resistance against heat and fire. The Nol Dappan dwarves are loathe to use such items, as it abates their suffering from the tremendous heat hey live under, but grudgingly use them if they must endure the suicidal levels of heat and flame in the bowels of the volcano they call home.
Abilities/Effects: While worn, you gain immunity to all fire damage and vulnerability to cold damage.
Stone Bridge
Wondrous item, rare
Description: This item appears to be a small model of a stone bridge.
History: One of the most important parts of any military campaign is the ability to move large numbers of troops rapidly across terrain.
Few things stop these movements like rivers and other bodies of water.
These miniature stone bridges were first 
developed long ago by the Imperium of Man during the devastating War of Empires. In the modern day, they are rare but are occasionally used by forces such as the Coryani Legions on major campaigns.
Abilities/Effects: As an action, you can place the bridge upon the ground and utter the command word, causing it to grow into a stone bridge. This bridge can be up to 50 feet long and 5 feet wide, or 25 feet long and 10 feet wide. There is a 3 feet stone rail that runs along the sides of the bridge. Once used, the bridge is permanent until eroded or destroyed as any other stone bridge would be. Once formed, the bridge is no longer magical.

Wondrous item, uncommon
Description: This stone, worn smooth by a thousand years of wear, is a three-inch oval of glossy obsidian. Inset into its surface are potent necromantic sigils, lined with frost. The stone itself is cold to the touch and unusually heavy for its size.
History: The mythical Pengik folk-hero Uvaneshar is said to have found a black stone on the night the black moon Aperio first rose in the sky. It was strangely cold and heavy, and he knew it belonged to the Lord of the Dead. He went through great adventures to return the stone to its owner, and in return he was taught many secrets, including how to duplicate the stone’s strange sigils on a piece of volcanic glass.

Wondrous item, uncommon

History: Most of the Altherians who constructed the ill-fated Khafre died during its destruction.
 
Not so Ekundayo val’Abebi, who was returning from a journey and watched the city’s destruction from afar. Wracked by maddening guilt she wandered aimlessly, and by luck or the will of Althares she found herself in a fishing village that bordered the Sea of Lanterns. They accepted her, and in gratitude she used her knowledge of Althares’ First Gift to craft the first stone of weightlessness from lodestone found in the area.

Tabard of Stealth
Wondrous item, very rare
(requires attunement by a worshiper of Cadic)
Description: This tabard is made from the blackest cloth and is crafted in such a way as to blend in well with shadows.
History: The many tales of silent and invisible Cadician assassins cause many to believe these tabards were handed down by Cadic himself at the dawn of time. In fact, the first of these tabards was not created until the first century. Damalis Iole, a Twilight Warrior, vanished into the Shadow Plane with three companions. A week later they emerged changed, and Damalis created the first tabard, claiming she had been taught the technique by servants of Cadic that dwelled within the Shadow Plane.

Tabard of Tenacity
Wondrous item, rare
Description: This surcoat is made of high quality heavy cloth.
History: Benigno Gervasio was many things. A man of short temper, a lover of many partners, and the master of the Fellowship of Savona. For all three of these reasons 
he had many enemies, and that made him a fourth thing: paranoid. He had some magical talent, and he spent many sleepless nights crafting a tabard that would protect him from the knives of his enemies. Unfortunately, this project took his attention away from the Fellowship, which allowed his second in command to usurp his position. To his credit, however, his tabard did cause the ensuing assassination attempt against him to fail. He was able to retire to Salantis, no longer as powerful, but much safer.
Abilities/Effects: If you are struck by a critical hit while this tabard is worn, as a reaction you may choose to turn the hit into a normal hit. Once used you may not call upon this tabard’s power again until the next dawn.

Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
Description: This amulet is designed to appear like a common silver locket, with a moon opal affixed to one side and an arcane rune inscribed on the other.
History: It is said that evil wears many faces, even kind ones, and with the creation of this fell item, adage has become truth. This item was created by a deranged Nerothian mage who would steal the identity of dead husbands before killing their widows so that they might be reunited in death. Since then, it has become a tool of the Inquisition, who must sometimes resort to drastic means to accomplish their goals.
 
Abilities/Effects: You may utilize this amulet’s power only if you possess the natural ability to read thoughts or are under the effects of the detect thoughts spell. If you wear this amulet while you are reading the thoughts of another, you may draw forth a painful memory of a lost loved one from your victim’s mind. The amulet magically disguises you and your voice to match that of the individual in the memory. Your target must make a successful DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or suffer disadvantage on attack rolls against you and saving throws against any of your spells or effects.
Tapestry of Portals
Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)
Description: This large, 10-foot by 10-foot cloth tapestry depicts a labyrinth with numerous doorways and stairways.
History: As the Azure Way and the Emerald Society continued their competing excavations into the labyrinth beneath the First City, they found their progress slowed by purely practical concerns. While a swift-moving human might be able to traverse the many twisting passageways in a reasonable amount of time, bringing heavy and bulky artifacts through debris-obstructed tunnels was difficult at best. In a rare show of cooperation, the two societies pooled their resources to tackle the problem. The result was the tapestry of portals, which is still used by both the Emerald Society and the Azure Way today. Both societies claim that their great minds developed this item, and that their competitors were little more than spies and dead weight. 
hooks to secure itself. Once unrolled you can use an action to speak the command word, opening a door on the tapestry to wall or a floor in a building which you have previously seen up to 500 feet away.

Tapestry of Tomb Guarding
Wondrous item, legendary
(requires attunement to a location [room])

Thurible of
Guarding and Warding
Wondrous item, very rare
(requires attunement to a location [building])
Description: These large gold censers, consisting of twelve pillars that support a shallow golden dish, are finely carved and specific to one of the gods of the Pantheon of Man. Each time the thurible is used, one of the twelve pillars that supports the golden dish melts and reforms into a smooth featureless pillar of iron.

Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)

For the new spell precognition refer to New Rules in Chapter 9. 
Timepiece of Hazanko
Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
Description: This item appears as a one-foot tall hourglass encased in a frame of dark chestnut wood. The frame itself was carved from an extremely hard wood found only in the Sword Fens; images of hounds, foxes, tortoises, hares, cheetahs, and other animal life grace the slender curves of the frame.
History: In far off Mhyrcia, hidden in the deep forests and jungles of the region, lives a gnome named Hazanko. Little is known about the stooped arcanist and Hazanko remains circumspect about his early years. Still, in the Shadow Towns, intelligent individuals can make a fortune from the rich trade across the Gulf of Coryan, regardless of their looks.
Hazanko is cursed like all his misbegotten kin, but unlike other gnomes, Hazanko is working on a cure.
He fully believes that his condition is temporary and is determined to purge every ounce of dwarven blood from his broken form. Hazanko has delved into dark secrets of biomancy, pouring over voluminous ancient texts, from ancient ssethric scrolls to tomes purportedly stolen from the libraries of Ymandragore. His mad experiments have led to many amazing creations, both beneficial and foul. One such item was the timepiece of Hazanko.
Abilities/Effects: This hourglass has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a result of 1, the hourglass loses all magical properties for 30 days, after which the timepiece regains 1 charge.
While this hourglass is held, you may use an action while inverting the hourglass to cast either haste or slow (save DC 14) by expending 1 charge, or time stop by expending 3 charges.
Titan-Bone Altar
Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement to a location [room])
Description: This large, menacing looking altar is made entirely of bone.
History: Far out in the depths of the Hinterlands lies a blasted wasteland known as the Graveyard of the Titans. Here, gigantic bones of long dead creatures rise out of the dried mud and windblown silt, silhouetted against the blaring noonday sun, silent sentinels of a forgotten age. Foul creatures of all types inhabit this region, and only the most heavily armed and well-supplied explorers dare to cross this region.
 
One of the strangest inhabitants of this land is Vehok val’Mordane, otherwise known as the Bone Mage. It is believed that Vehok is a necromancer from Canceri that accompanied an ill-fated expedition to the Ghost Jackal Cairns. The Bone Mage resides inside a tower made from the titanic bones of some ancient behemoth, and uses the native Hua’gi goblins as slaves, or worse.
In a small chamber atop his rib-cone tower sits a strange structure representing the pinnacle of the Bone Mage’s power. In the center of the room lies an altar, built from the bones of men and ancient creatures. The claws of some huge behemoth form posts in the corners of the altar to which captives or corpses can be tied spread eagle. Adorned with skulls of hyena men, harpies, and other humanoids, the entire scene proves to be a macabre spectacle. The true terror of this device comes into focus on the dark moonless nights that sometimes settle over the wasteland. On those nights, the Bone Mage lays a fresh corpse upon the altar and performs profane rites. At midnight, the corpse rises, animated in a mockery of life, to serve its new master in death.
Abilities/Effects: This altar can be attuned to any room 100 square feet or less. The ritual to attune the altar requires the sacrifice of 4 sentient creatures which become zombies. These zombies remain near the altar at all times and attack anyone who tries to destroy it.
Once attuned, placing a freshly deceased creature on the altar during a moonless night causes the corpse to raise as a zombie. Placing a freshly deceased creature upon the altar and burning 200 gp worth of incense causes the corpse to rise as a ghoul. Undead created by the altar cannot be controlled by the process described below. The zombies created when the altar was attuned to its location can never be controlled. Any undead which move farther than 1 mile from the altar are destroyed. 
As an action, a creature can touch the altar and expend a spell slot. Expending a 5th level spell slot or lower lets the creature assert control over undead created with the altar as if casting animate dead at a spell level equal to the slot level expended. Expending a 9th level spell slot or lower lets the creature assert control over undead created with the altar as if casting create undead at a spell level equal to the slot level expended.
Any undead with a CR 1 or higher that come within 1 mile of the altar must make a DC 18 Charisma saving throw or fall under the control of the altar. Those that make their save constantly feel a “pull” to the altar’s location and may seek it out but are not under its control.
The titan-bone altar is 10 feet long by 8 feet wide and 3 feet high, and weighs 900 lbs. It has AC 15 and 100 hit points. If destroyed, all undead created by the altar are released from its control. The altar then reforms 100 days later in a random uninhabited location on the same plane. See Location Attunement Sidebar, pg. 103.
Toga of Office
Wondrous item, uncommon
Description: This pristine white toga has a single deep green bar as trim, denoting its wearer as a member of one of Coryan’s leading families.
History: Milo Corvanus was elevated to patrician of the fledgling Coryani Empire by the First Emperor himself before the battle of Hope’s End. His son Linus, was among the first generation born with no knowledge of the Time of Terror. Unlike his father, he rankled at his green-trimmed toga setting him apart from the gold-trimmed togas of the val. To compensate for this, he crafted the first toga of office. While many of the older generation found this a sign of vulgarity and ingratitude, many of his generation, and subsequent generations, had similar togas crafted. The use of such a toga is considered scandalous if discovered, but is barely tolerated among humans. Val, however, are expected to get by on skill alone. After all, they are the Chosen of the Gods.
Abilities/Effects: While worn you have advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks.
As a bonus action, you may force a creature who can hear and see you within 20 feet to make a DC 16 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save they suffer disadvantage on all Charisma (Persuasion) checks for 1 minute. On a successful save your opponent feels as if they were intimidated, but nothing else. Once you use this ability you cannot use it again until you complete a short rest.
Troll’s Lament
Wondrous item (gauntlet), rare
Description: Fashioned from finely tooled leather, dyed a deep crimson red, and affixed with hardened obsidian spikes, 
this spiked gauntlet strikes fear into the heart of trolls.
History: Gelvira was one of many Nol Dappan followers of the Sword of the Heavens after his reemergence, but his disappearance in the Blessed Lands left her confused and without a purpose. Partially to follow in his footsteps, and partially to seek the will of Nier, Gelvira took the path of the pilgrim. In the Corlathian Mountains her band of faithful were assaulted by Singarthan trolls, who cornered them within caves. With few tools at her disposal, Gelvira was nonetheless able to create gauntlets enchanted with fire, and held off the trolls until the pilgrims were rescued by the Soldier Saints of Dagha. Feeling the touch of purpose in her defense of others, Gelvira crafted troll’s lament, building on the makeshift gauntlets that had saved her life. She has since joined the Soldier Saints, and trolls seeking to prey on pilgrims have learned to fear her flames.
Abilities/Effects: While wearing this gauntlet you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls with your unarmed strikes, which are considered magical weapons. As a bonus action, you can enshroud your gauntlet in magical flames, making your unarmed strikes deal an additional 1d4 fire damage. These flames may be used to set flammable objects alight, and shed bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet beyond that. You may extinguish these flames as a bonus action.
Bolts of Flame (Requires Attunement): While wearing this gauntlet you can cast fire bolt, using Constitution as your spellcasting ability.
Urn of Fool’s Booty
Wondrous item, very rare
Description: This beautiful ceramic vase, crafted by less than honorable illusionists, is illegal in most of the Known Lands. They bear a glamour inside them that makes coins, gems or jewelry placed inside to appear more valuable.
History: It is a sad fact that not everyone opposed the Infernals during the Time of Terror. One merchant doing business in the trading hub of the Plexus was swayed by promises of riches into a number of demonic pacts. This urn was the result of one such deal, and made him a very rich man, at least until he was murdered by a customer angered by his no-refund policy. The fact that these items are created even today via infernal pact is not widely known, or else they would be considered heretical, rather than merely illegal.
Abilities/Effects: While this urn is held you may use an action to place up to 500 gp worth of jewelry, gems, or coins within it. For 1 hour, all items placed into the urn appear to be more valuable, doubling their worth. If a creature examines an item from the urn and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw they can see through the urn’s illusion. All items placed in the urn revert to their normal appearance after 12 hours. Once used, the urn loses its magical properties until 7 days have passed. 
Valor Guards
Wondrous item, uncommon
Description: Decorated with carved images of holy champions, and other righteous warriors, these bracers bolster their wearer and inspire them to greater acts of bravery and valor.
History: Galaros Fen was raised in the elemental traditions of Lhyllifel, and even given an elorii name by his Undir parents. But when beasts attacked his caravan it was not the Elementalists who saved him, but a band of adventuring holy champions of the Mother Church. In them Galaros found a sense of purpose he had lacked. He converted, and in tribute to the brave adventurers who had saved him he made the first valor guards, decorated with their battle against the beasts. Later versions of these items would depict other scenes, but always prominently featuring the holy champions of the Mother Church.
Abilities/Effects: While these bracers are worn any time you are targeted by a spell or effect which imposes the frightened condition you may use a reaction to gain advantage on a saving throw against the spell or effect.

History: These vestments were created by Hermine Althaus for the Hurrianites who served Overprince Walport val’Holryn in battle against the infernal horde during the Time of Terror. These Hurrianites gained great renown as defenders of innocents during the First Crusade, and the infernals tried many times to find and slay Hermine, or to discover the secret of crafting corrupted vestments 

CURSGD Items
Boots of the Far -Traveled
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
Description: These boots appear to be old, well-worn boots and bear the holy symbol of Anshar, Goddess of Travelers.
History: Life in the gnome slums outside Tir Betoq was hard for Sava. When a wandering priest of Anshar passed through, she begged to accompany him. He agreed, and took her to his small chapel in the Western Lands. Most Ansharans protect the downtrodden, but this priest was corrupt and treated the poor gnome as a slave. With nowhere else to turn, she swore vengeance. Her twisted body made physical revenge unlikely, but her mind was sharp, and she turned it toward magic. She created these boots, knowing they would be stolen by the cruel priest. She began leaving bait outside the chapel, drawing wild beasts. It was only a matter of time before the priest was attacked and sought to use her boots to escape. Then Sava had her revenge.

History: Liginaosh, a brilliant but spurned gnome, grew tired of being ridiculed and chased out of taverns when he politely asked for food. After a particularly brutal beating at one inn, he invented a device to help him steal the food that he was being denied.

Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
Description: This necklace appears as a mismatched set of teeth on a leather thong.
History: The origins of the first of these malicious items is believed to be a strange cult of feral humans living in the wilds of Uggur, a vast and trackless wasteland filled with savages and beasts. The little that is known of their origins, mainly from the carvings upon the fangs, points towards the Seekers of the Waxing Moon, a sect devoted to some dark and hoary god.

Description: This large, waterlogged sea chest is bound in tarnished brass and smells of brine and rot.
History: When the Yarricite priests of Naeraanth went to the newly conquered province of Salantis to confront the Yarric Heresy they did not do so naively.
They brought a newly enchanted Yarricite item, a sea chest that could produce a fog bank. This would disorient any peasant resistance while the inquisitors took whatever steps were necessary. When they were later attacked by abominable forces, they sought to use the chest to escape. They failed. The next morning revealed that whatever forces had attacked them had transfigured the chest into a waterlogged and rotting thing, and to the horror of the returning inquisitors those who had been left dead in its presence rose the next night.

Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)
Description: These plain circlets are slim and easily concealed.
History: The notorious Retsev Rah, of the Harvesters, traveled Onara for many years disguised as a merchant and selling magical items, including circlets said to grant the power of the dreaded Ordainers. These items were linked to Ymandragore, and allowed the Harvesters to compromise many of the Sanctorum of the Arcane and kidnap numerous mages. Once his true identity was known, any remaining circlets were carefully examined, and duplicates without the Ymandragoran link were made by the militant Hawks of the Sanctorum. But Retsev was a cunning artificer and carefully embedded curses within his work, so that those mages that sought to use the circlets against the Ordainers soon found themselves vulnerable to their greatest foes.

History: Pomona Fusia was married to a beast of a man, yet for the sake of her family she endured his cruelties for as long as she was able. Finally, she threw herself on the mercy of the Temple of Larissa, who saw her bruises and offered her sanctuary, but she hesitated. Her family was dependent on her husband’s good will for their survival, and she could not leave him. Her husband was a regular visitor to the Larissan brothels, and this granted another opportunity. Rousanak val’Sheem, artificer of the temple, crafted this bracelet, and arranged for the val’Assante’s favorite brothel girl to gift it to him. Soon he found himself unable to resist serving his wife in all things, though Pomona treated him far better than he had treated her.

Wondrous item, very rare
Description: This cotton tabard is embroidered with crossed arcs of lightning on the front of it.
History: This tabard was commissioned by Duke Baldawin val’Tensen, second Duke of Moratavia, for his Hurrianic troops. The Duke’s artificers lamented that they were unable to weave together the enchantments requested without creating the curse as a side-effect, but the Duke was untroubled, boldly proclaiming that the warriors of Hurrian would never refuse those in need. Soon, however, he realized that in battle one had to make difficult choices, sacrificing a few to save many more, and that these strategies weakened those men gifted with the tabard, including the Duke himself. Since that time the tabard has been retired from regular service, and now they are only worn by the most devout Hurrianites.

RODS
Archaeologists Rod
Rod, very rare (optional attunement)
Description: This silvery, foot long rod is unadorned but for series of runes etched in a spiral pattern down its length. It is topped by a triangular head, leading some to believe it was created by Sarishans.
History: This rod was created by an Altherian secret society, the Seekers of Forbidden Lore, to expedite their exploration of the ancient, forbidden ruins of the Tenecian civilization. The Council of Wisdom, which governs the Republic of Altheria, has declared exploration of that ruined capital city prohibited unless sanctioned and accompanied by an authorized scholar. This led to a scarcity of historians with knowledge of that era. Though never proven, many attribute the disappearance of historians and other scholars throughout the Known Lands to the Seekers of Forbidden Lore, who somehow drained their accumulated knowledge and placed it into these rods.
Abilities/Effects: This rod may be used either attuned or unattuned. If not attuned, while held you gain advantage on all Intelligence (History) checks related to architecture, stonework, and masonry. You also instinctively know which direction is north.

Rod of the Reaper
Rod, legendary
(requires attunement by a spellcaster)
Description: This elaborately carved, two-and-a-half-foot long rod of mahogany, bound with black iron bands topped with a mummified hand.
History: It is perhaps not surprising that this rod was created in Ventaka, but despite what many might think it was not designed to be a necrotic weapon. Bala val’Mordane intended to enchant the mummified hand with the ability to make another invisible. Bala, however, was cruel to her apprentice Chetana, and in retaliation the apprentice sabotaged the master’s artifact. To Bala’s horror, the demonstration of the rod slew the val’Mordane noble she had intended to vanish. Fler neck was saved, however, when the noble arose as a zombie. The undead patriarchs of the val’Mordane family were intrigued by the possibilities of such a weapon, and gave Bala high honor and an order for a dozen more.
Abilities/Effects: You may wield this rod as a magic mace which deals 2d8 necrotic damage upon a successful hit against a living creature, in addition to its normal damage. Additionally, upon a successful hit you may use a reaction to send a surge of necrotic energy though the target’s body, forcing them to make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or suffer an additional 7d8+30 points of necrotic damage, or half as much on a successful saving throw. Once this ability is used it may not be called upon again until after 
the next midnight. Lastly, if you successfully kill a living humanoid with this ability, they rise on the following turn as a zombie under your control for as long as you are attuned to the rod. You may only possess a single zombie at a time, and creating a new zombie destroys your previous zombie.

Tomas Ramunas, archdruid of the sect in the eighth century, lived without food or water for three days on the rock face of the largest cliff, exposed to the elements, seeking guidance from Saluwe. After he had recovered, he threw himself into the creation of this rod. It has been handed down by the druids ever since, and is used to initiate new members by having them live among the birds for three days, in honor of Tomas.

History: Crafted by the wandering Ansharan mystic, Tholosus val’Inares, as he searched for the fabled Vault of Stars. Since Ansharan Gates must be travelled through once so that it may be accessed again, the Ansharans methodically search the continent for lost Portals. Tholosus believed that the Vault of Stars not only contained a map of every active Ansharan Gate, but could be used to travel to anyone of them at will, without previously attuning oneself to them. Sadly, though he discovered over a dozen of previously unknown Portals, Tholosus died before completing his self-appointed quest. As his health was failing, he instructed his small cadre of ascetic priests to craft staves like his, so that they might complete his quest. To date, the existence and location of the Vault of Stars remains a mystery.

History: Among the elorii there are none so attuned to water as the Berokene, and among the Berokene there are no mariners so skilled as the Berotar of Entaris. It was soon after the founding of this order that the Berotar were sorely tested, by the sahuagin and their Ssethregoran allies. Despite their skill, the Berotar suffered greatly in the first assault. Then Issalas, captain of the Lanthras, took the wreckage of her once mighty vessel and crafted the first staff of the deep.

Description: At first glance, this staff appears to be made of ebony wood, but upon closer inspection, the staff is constantly shifting with swirls and eddies, as if a sea of blackness is contained within the staff.
History: None now speak of Priska the Shadowed, Twilight Warrior of the Imperium. Her name has been struck from the ranks of that order, and her theories on the Realm of Shadow are reviled as heresy. Yet her experiments produced results, including these staves, her greatest creation. It is said that in the end all color had drained from Priska. She was slain by her fellow Twilight Warriors after she joined with the creatures of shadow, and sought to lead them in vengeance against her brethren.

To their leader, the Ujch’ki, the sentinel staff was given. Over the years the worship of Saluwé has diminished, as the Shadow Towns have been swayed by the elemental worship of nearby Entaris.

With this fell creation he transformed his men into undead as the elorii slaughtered them. After his ascent to godhood his successor entombed him with his staff, and crafted another for himself. Until the fall of the Hegemony each Phaeron crafted such a staff, and were buried with it upon their death. A few of these staves have been looted by tomb robbers, and at least one is known to be held in the city of Ventaka.

If you attempt to control more undead, undead previously controlled are no longer subject to this effect. The newly freed undead may attack you or others.

Staff of Cats
Staff, very rare (requires attunement by a worshipper ofSarish)
Description: The staff of cats is a quarterstaff made of wood with subtle carvings depicting felines in various poses. The staff has at the base, five small spikes embedded into the wood which is carved to resemble cat claws. The two handgrips, positioned as for a quarterstaff, are silver.
History: It is said that the first staff of cats was created by Sherfiruz Mizra, a Cancerese sorcerer-priest, who led a small group living in the woods north of Nishanpur during the Shadowed Age. Rumors told by woodsmen and rangers told of the group summoning and cavorting with Infernals.
 
Priests of Sarish led an “investigation” that assaulted and demolished the village. Mizra was captured and the other members were made to denounce her before being executed. The priests confiscated all their records to prevent the resurrection of the cult. To this day, contradictory rumors say that Mizra and his followers were either worshipping a fallen Valinor or paying legitimate respect to Sarish with an emphasis upon His feline followers. The only surviving notes from Mizra’s studies are the instructions for creating the staff of cats, which can still be found in the records of the Temple of Sarish in Nishanpur.
Abilities/Effects: This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff and possesses a permanently scribed rune of grace, allowing this quarterstaff to be used as a finesse weapon.

Staff of Clouds
Staff legendary
(requires attunement by an arcane spellcaster)
Description: This staff is made of twisting willow wood, shod with silver and capped with a crystal of azurite held in place by a lattice of silver wire.
History: When Altheria briefly became a protectorate of Entaris, the Osalikene mage Parias was overjoyed. A firm believer in the prophecy of Ardelia, and a proponent of alliance with human nations for hundreds of years, she crafted this staff to commemorate the occasion. The Altherians promised her gift would see good use in the Shining Patrol. When Altheria broke from Entaris, Parias took it as a personal affront and demanded the return of her gift. Before it could be returned, however, the warrior who held it was ambushed by Ssethregorans, and the staff was lost. In a rage Parias abandoned devotion to Ardelia, and swore to oppose humanity always, distributing the additional staves she had created among the elorii.

Staff of Deadly Wards
Staff very rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)
Description: Crafted from bamboo imported from the distant Khitani Empire, this staff appears segmented, with sigils carved into the space between the natural ridges of the wood.
History: Li Meirong of the Khitani Empire began her pilgrimage to the Blessed Lands some years after the second Coryani-Khitani war. A sorceress of no small skill, when the Soldier Saints of Dagha offered her protection she scoffed at them, for they had no Khitani in their company. She showed them this staff, which she had crafted herself in her homeland, and declared that this alone would be sufficient to protect her. It is true that the staff helped her escape many deadly predicaments, but the dangers of the Blessed Lands eventually led to her end. The Soldier Saints recovered the staff and gifted it to the Khitani of the First City, and since that time they have ensured their ranks include Khitani as well as Coryani peoples.

Staff of Dreams
Staff very rare (requires attunement by a primal spellcaster)
Description: The Staff of Dreams is made of several segments of horn connected by bands of gleaming white ivory. There are no engravings in the ivory, but anyone staring into the gleaming ivory will see movement of tiny figures just beneath the surface.
History: These staves befuddle scholars with contradictions. They were certainly the work of Horatiu Dragosi, who crafted the first such staff in the tenth century. However, they are mentioned in tremendous detail in the play “Dreams of Kla Myrtha,” which was written two hundred years prior for the Theater of the Umbral Mask in Censure. These staves travel freely into Dreamtime, yet shamans who have studied them conclude that they have no connection with that realm. Those who stare at the staff see figures beneath the surface, yet it is clearly solid horn and ivory. House Dragosi not only refuses to divulge the secrets of the staves, but refuses to acknowledge there are secrets, insisting that those who point out the contradictions are merely suffering from a lack of sleep.
Abilities/Effects: This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that ignores the resistances of ethereal creatures. Also, as long as this staff is on your person, you gain advantage on saving throws against the dream spell and if you ever enter Dreamtime, also known as the Spirit Realm, the staff manifests with you.
Spells: This staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells, using your spell save DC and spell attack bonus: protection from good and evil (1 charge), see invisibility (2 charges), magic circle (3 charges), and dream (5 charges).
This staff regains 1d6+4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you ever expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff retains its bonus to attack and damage rolls but loses all other properties until this staff is taken and left in Dreamtime for 24 hours, at which point it regains 1 charge.
Staff of the Oceanwalker
Staff (unique), legendary (requires attunement)
Description: This staff appears a hue of shimmering blue, a side effect of the enchantment upon the driftwood used to create this magical item.
History: In the Pirate Isles, there is an old myth of a man from the sea. He was given the nickname Oceanwalker by a fishing captain who was lost at sea during a particularly violent storm and claimed to have seen a shimmering light through nearly impenetrable downpour. As the ship was pummeled by the waves, he slowly steered his ship closer to the strange light. Wiping the water from his eyes, he rushed to the rail and doubted his rheumy eyes — there, barely twenty yards from his ship, walked a man carrying the light that had drawn the old sea captain; a light that slowly resolved itself into a shimmering blue staff. The man, not twenty yards away, walked calmly on the water like the storm wasn’t even there! 
Fearing that they had been lured to the deaths by some sort of vengeful water spirit, the captain was about to steer his ship away when the man with the staff stopped, looked back over his shoulder and pointed in the opposite direction. He then proceeded to continue walking and disappeared into the storm. Though the ship almost floundered numerous times through the night, the ship weathered the storm and reached port, having headed the direction given to them by man with the staff.
Now and again some old sea dog will wander into a tavern telling of a man who walked on the water. Some say he swims like a fish, or rode upon an elemental manifestation of the sea itself, but all the stories agree on one detail, he is always carrying a shimmering blue staff, the Staff of the Oceanwalker.
Abilities/Effects: This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to both attack and damage rolls. While holding this staff, you unerringly know the direction of the closest natural body of water larger than a small pond.
Spells: This staff has 20 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more chargers to cast one of the following spells, using your spell save DC and spell attack bonus: create or destroy water (1 charge), speak with animals (aquatic only) (1 charge), water breathing (3 charges), water walk (3 charges), conjure minor elementals (water only) (4 charges), and conjure elementals (water only) (5 charges).
This staff regains 2d8 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you ever expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff retains its bonus to attack and damage rolls but loses all other properties until this staff is submerged in the sea by a priest of either Yarris or by an Osalikene elorii priest, at which point it regains ld8+2 charges.
Staff of Wizardry
Staff legendary
(requires attunement by an arcane caster)
Description: These staffs are all crafted from twisted, knotted darkwood, polished to a smooth finish. The top of the staff is capped with a precious gemstone.
History: All the great practitioners of the arcane throughout all the civilizations that have flourished and fallen throughout the Known Lands, have crafted their own Staff of Wizardry as a symbol of their mastery.
From the great magi of ages past like the ssanu sorcerer Ss’koreth, the elorii Grand
 
Elementalist Rasmirinas, the Arch Magi of the Imperium of Man, Orris val’Mordane to the modern age arcane master, Nurion val’Assante, all wielded Staffs of Wizardry, albeit differing in appearance.
Though it requires one supremely skilled to craft these staffs, they are quite durable, allowing those not as gifted to find ancient copies in the many crypts and ruins that dot Arcanis. Recently, an excavation in the Undercity below the First City uncovered a large, moldering crate containing six of these staffs. Some believe that the area must have acted as underground storage for some sort of academy of sorcery, whose existence was lost to the ages.
Abilities/Effects: This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +3 bonus to * both attack and damage rolls.
Spells: This staff possesses 50 charges for the following properties:
Saving Throws: When attuned to this staff and wielding it, you gain advantage on all saving throws.
Spellcasting Modifier: While wielding this staff, your Ability Score used for spellcasting is considered to be 25. If your Ability Score is already equal to or greater than the score granted by the staff, this ability has no effect on you.
Spell Levels: When casting a spell, the wielder of this staff may, as a reaction, expend any number of charges to empower that spell, casting it as a higher spell slot than it normally would be.
For example, if the caster casts cure wounds as a 1st level spell, they may expend eight charges of this staff to cast this spell as if it were cast as a 9th level spell.
Spell Absorption: As a reaction, when targeted by a hostile spell you may absorb that spell into the staff of wizardry.
The absorbed spell’s effect is cancelled and the spell’s energy—though not the spell itself—is stored within the staff. The staff gains a number of charges equal to the level of the absorbed spell. Should the staff absorb more than the maximum 50 charges through this method, the staff discharges all its energy into the wielder, dealing hit point damage equal to the total number of charges in the staff, including those over and above the maximum 50 charges. This staff regains 6d6+6 expended charges daily at dawn.
Stormhorn
Staff very rare (requires attunement)
Description: A Stormhorn is a magical staff crafted from the twisted tapering horns of a behir. A single light blue horn is affixed to a handle carved from the heartwood of an oak tree struck by lightning, and enchanted during a lightning storm. 
History: Along the edge of the Amaryllis River, and along the coastline of Bhiharn, lies a dense tangle of mangrove swamps and murky salt marshes known as the Sword Fens. This fetid Swampland is home to the Undir, and serves mainly as a refuge for highwaymen and pirates. This region is best known for the horrid monsters that lurk in its mosquito-infested depths; trolls, hags and worse can be found within its lush green canopy. It is here that the Kio travel to gather the components necessary for Stormhorns. Though it is rumored that these fell beasts still roam the primeval swamps of the Kraldjur Morass, it is only in the Sword Fens that they can be encountered with any regularity. Finding and killing one of these huge beasts is no easy task, but once accomplished, the Kio collect their prize: a pair of long tapering horns that jut from the behir’s head.
Abilities/Effects: This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +1 bonus to both attack and damage rolls.
This staff possesses 10 charges for the following properties.
Behir’s Gift: While holding this staff, as an action, you may expend 5 charges to call forth a wave of lighting 20 feet long by 5 feet wide.
Every creature within this area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or suffer 6dl0 lighting damage, or half on a successful saving throw.
Thunderous Smite: After successfully striking a foe in melee with this staff, as a bonus action you may expend 1 charge to deal an additional 2dl2 thunder damage.
This staff regains 2d4+2 expended charges daily at dawn. If you ever expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff retains its bonus to attack and damage rolls but loses all other properties until this staff is struck by a natural bolt of lightning, at which point it regains 1 charge. On a 20, the staff regains 1 charge.
Sylab’s Staff
Stajf, legendary (requires attunement by an arcane spell caster)
Description: The staff has numerous functions, all of which are triggered by changing the settings of the small gears set into the staff’s metal shaft. The staff itself is just about a man’s height and made from a dull grey steel. Set into its base is a scratched and pitted metal sphere, and capped with the carved head of a nightfox.
History: Sylab was not always Arena Master of Sicaris.
Fie once was a lowly gladiator, skilled in battle, but condemned by his lack of showmanship. That changed when he caught the eye of Gioia vaFFiaupt, who was seeking a gladiator to invest in. She saw that Sylab not only fought with unparalleled skill, but he understood
 
the business of the arena. As for his showmanship, that was easily supplemented. If he lacked personality, he would simply need a gimmick. Thus, she crafted this staff. With it, Sylab quickly became famous, dazzling audiences who breathlessly waited to see how he would configure his staff for the killing blow. His winnings made Gioia very rich, and earned Sylab the respect he needed to become Arena Master.
Abilities/Effects: This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +1 bonus to both attack and damage rolls.
By adjusting the clockwork mechanisms in the staff, the wielder may launch the carved head of the nightfox forth as a grappling hook connected to the staff by a 50-foot steel chain. Additional adjustments can alter the staff to function as a great club, a mancatcher staff or a spiked chain. The wielder of this staff is considered to have proficiency in all weapon forms of this staff.
Spells: This staff has 20 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more chargers to cast one of the following spells, using your spell save DC and spell attack bonus: command (1 charge), hold person (2 charge), invisibility (2 charges), web (3 charges), and hold monster (5 charges).
This staff regains 2d8+4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you ever expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff retains its bonus to attack and damage rolls but loses all other properties until this staff is bathed in the blood of a fallen gladiator, at which point it regains 1 charge.
See Chapter Nine for the rules and properties of a mancatcher and spiked chain.
Tzizhet’s Gibbering Staff
Stajf, legendary (requires attunement by an arcane caster worshipper of Tzizhet or divine caster of Tzizhet)
Description: This is a gnarled staff made of worm-eaten pale wood with many sickly discolored knots and small protrusions. When any of the powers are activated, the staff becomes fleshy and pulsates like a living thing, with the knots on the wand opening, revealing multicolored eyes and gnashing teeth. 
History: Merishayeet sought one thing and one thing only, and that was to drive the Coryani from Abessios. In the fourth century, he received a vision, dark and blasphemous, which led him deep into the wilderness, and to the ruins of sunken Myrantis itself. He entered the ruins sane, if obsessed. After two weeks, he left it raving mad, missing an arm and an eye, and wielding the staff that he had carved and enchanted using secrets whispered to him within the ruins. Merishayeet sowed chaos among the Coryani before he was slain, but the staff was never recovered. Throughout the ages the staff has reappeared, always in the hands of a mad Myrantian prophet and rebel. Always it has been lost again upon the madman’s death.
Abilities/Effects: This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +1 bonus to both attack and damage rolls.
This staff possesses 20 charges for the following properties:
Confusing Smite: Any time you successfully strike someone in melee with this staff you may expend 1 charge as a bonus action to deal an additional 1d6 psychic damage as well as forcing the target to make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or suffer the effects of the confusion spell until the end of their next turn.
Transmogrification of Madness: While holding this staff, you may, as an action, expend 10 charges to transform your staff into a gibbering mouther. It appears adjacent to you, is friendly to you and your companions, and acts on its own initiative. You possess a mental link with the creature through which you may issue commands (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to the gibbering mouther, it simply attacks the nearest creature. The gibbering mouther remains for 1 hour unless destroyed or dismissed by you as an action. Once dismissed or destroyed, the gibbering mouther disappears with a foul¬smelling mist equal to a stinking cloud (Save DC 14) as and the staff reappears in your hand as long both you and the gibbering mouther were on the same plane of existence.
Spells: This staff has 20 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more to cast one of the following spells, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability modifier: magic mouth (2 charge), arcane eye (4 charges), confusion (4 charges), and see invisibility (2 charges).

WfinDS
Wand of Anshar’s Blessing
Wand, very rare
(requires attunement by a worshipper of Anshar)
Description: This wand resembles a warped piece of wood with sharp red thorns.
History: Most worshippers of the goddess Anshar pray to Her as the patron of travelers and guardian of outcasts, but Her domains encompass pain and suffering, as well.
A heretical cult worshipping Her aspect as the Agonized Martyr crafted this wand to share Her blessings with the world. They believe that only through extreme pain can one find enlightenment. They sought to share the gift of agony with others, and quickly ran afoul of the Coryani Inquisition. Though most cells were quickly expunged, a few escaped, still spreading their heretical teachings, gifting their wands to both the depraved and the unsuspecting.
Abilities/Effects: This wand has 7 charges. While holding this wand, as an action you can point it at a creature you can see within 60 feet and expend 1 charge to make barbed vines erupt from the creature’s arms, legs and torso, anchoring it to the ground. The creature takes 3d6 magical piercing damage, and unless it succeeds on a DC 16 Constitution save it is paralyzed for 1 minute. As an action on the creature’s turn, it can make another saving throw to free itself and end the effect early.
The wand regains 1d6 +1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a roll of 1, you gain 1 level of exhaustion as the wand wraps a vine around you, draining some of your life force to regain 1 charge.
Wand of Dancing Spirits
Wand, uncommon (requires attunement by a primal spellcaster)
Description: This wand is silver plated, runes stamped laterally from handle to tip.
History: During the reign of Osric II the first serious effort was made to explore and catalogue the Faerdwalden. During these efforts Senta val’Abebi, one of the chief researchers, had a strange encounter in the woods that convinced her a species dwelled within who could turn themselves invisible at will. The explorations were abandoned long before completion due to the costs of King Osric’s wars, but Senta’s obsession with these creatures only grew. She created the wand of dancing spirits to help her craft illusions as bait for these creatures, and illuminate their invisible forms in faerie fire. She never produced 
results, and when the explorations were abandoned she stubbornly entered the Faerdwalden, vowing not to return until she had proof. She was never seen again.
Abilities/Effects: This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend one charge to cast faerie fire (save DC 14) from it. In addition, while holding this wand the range at which you can cast minor illusion is doubled.
The wand regains 1d6+1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand’s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand melts and dissolves into nothingness.
Wand of Distraction
Wand, uncommon
(requires attunement by a primal spellcaster)
Description: This wand is slim and metallic in its construction. A poorly etched rune of lightning is inscribed upon it.
History: Darius val’Holryn was jealous of his cousin, Leticia, whose bloodline ability mimicked the val’Tensen. This allowed her to call down lightning from the sky, while he benefited from the val’Abebi bloodline powers, which gave him a superb memory and a penchant for knowledge. As they grew older, Darius would fume as Leticia would strike down the enemies of the family with coruscating bolts of energy, while he was told that he would serve best from a desk and surrounded by musty books.
After reading treatise written by the Archmagi Nurion, it occurred to him that he could immediate and perhaps exceed his cousin’s powers by fashioning a wand of lightning.
Working with the family artificer, he quickly inscribed the lightning rune and joined his family in a quick sojourn to Ashvan, near the border with Canceri. On the road, they were attacked and Darius arrogantly stepped in front of his father, a warrior of renown, and fired his wand. To his utter humiliation, a shower of sparks and swirling fireworks, distracting the attacker long enough for his father to dispatch him.
Abilities/Effects: This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use your reaction and expend one charge to cause a creature within 30 feet to make a Dexterity saving throw, DC 16. If the creature fails, until the end of its next turn it suffers disadvantage on all attack rolls, ability checks and saving throws.
The wand regains ld4+l expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand’s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand will no longer function and becomes non-magical.
 
Wand of Grasping Earth
Wand, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster)
Description: This wand is grey ash in color, with a tip that corkscrews slightly.
History: Despite the power they wield, the greatest threat to mages are the superstitious and fearful country folk. Many mages, usually ones that have recently discovered their gift, have fallen victim to angry mobs and beaten or killed.
The masters of the Sanctorum of the Arcane understand that these attacks are fueled by ignorance rather than malicious intent and created a wand that deals with these mobs in a non-lethal manner. The wand of grasping earth is given to members that search for untrained mages, taking them where they can safely train. The wand causes the very ground to reach up, tripping and entangling foes, giving them time to escape without causing permanent harm to their pursuers.
Abilities/Effects: This wand has 7 charges. While holding this wand, as an action you can expend 1 charge to cast
entangle (save DC 15).
The wand regains ld6 +1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a roll of 1, the wand withers and crumbles into dust.
Wand of Ice
Wand, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster)
Description: This wand appears as a branched icicle and very cold to the touch.
History: Strange as it may seem, the first wand of ice was created in the deserts of the Coryani province of Toranesta, in what is now the Abessian Dominion. Tatiana Gracci, a distant scion of the Coryani Gracci family, despised the heat of the desert. Although a legionnaire with little magical talent, she was determined to develop a way to keep herself cool. After spending all her spare time in experimentation, she ultimately failed. But in her failure, she created something far more useful, which served her legion well on the battlefield.
Abilities/Effects: This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend one charge to cast black ice (save DC 14) from it. When you use the wand this way, the spell creates a patch of black ice instead of an oil slick.
The wand regains ld6+l expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand’s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand melts and dissolves into nothingness.
See Chapter Nine for the black ice spell

# Wondrous items
## ALTAR OF UNYIELDING FAITH
Wondrous item, very rare, requires installation 

Install this altar in your temple and choose a row on the Servitors chart (page 31). Whenever you roll on 
this chart, you may choose the chart entry one higher than the result you rolled. 

## CANDLES OF ACCORD
Wondrous item, rare, requires installation
This pair of red wax candles burn magically without consuming fuel, symbolizing the alliance between the two holders of the candles. If one candle is lit without the 
other, it merely provides normal candlelight indefinitely, and extinguishing it does not affect the other candle. 
If both candles are lit together by the owner of an establishment, the owner can give the other candle to an ally and extend the area of the owner’s Gather 
Intel ability to include their ally’s demesne. 
When used in this way, extinguishing either candle snuffs out the other one immediately. Gathering Intel using a candle of accord requires med-
itating for 1 hour with the candle, concentrating on the ally and their territory. At the end of this hour, the owner may make a Gather Intel check, which if successful gives 
them a vision of the organization they are spying on.

## DIPLOMAT’S POUCH
Wondrous item, uncommon
A letter placed in this pouch, addressed to someone who owns another diplomat’s pouch, disappears, and the recipient listed in the letter finds a copy of it in their pouch. A letter can be listed to multiple recipients with a diplomat’s pouch.


## MANTLE OF REGENCY
Wondrous item, rare, requires attunement
This billowing red cloak has a mind of its own. It grants the user 30 feet of fly (hover) speed while worn. As an action, the owner can summon the mantle to them, though how long it takes to arrive depends on how far away it is (it flies much faster when not being worn).
You are a much more impressive figure while wearing the mantle. You have advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks, and whenever you roll on a follower chart, you can select any result within 10% of your roll.


## SPYMASTER’S CLOAK
Wondrous item, uncommon
People who meet you tend to forget you. Gather Intel checks have disadvantage against anyone wearing this fine grey cloak.


## SURVEYOR’S COMPASS
Wondrous item, rare
A compass of dwarven origin. Above the north marking of the compass is a small receptacle. Once per season, placing a piece of ore or precious stone into it causes the needle on the compass to point toward the nearest seam containing that material within 12 miles. This seam holds ore and gems worth 4d4 × 100 gp, and mining the seam takes three weeks.

## THE TAPESTRY OF REWEAVING
Wondrous item, rare, requires installation
This magnificent tapestry at first appears to display a scene depicting life in the local area. The threads are expensively dyed, and real gold and silver are woven into it, giving it brilliant colors and incredibly fine detail. Expressions can be made out on the tiny faces of any people living nearby.Watching the tapestry closely reveals it is not an idyllic depiction of a time gone by—it is live. It shows what is actually happening around the area in which it is installed. It is impossible to detect motion while looking at it, however—one only notices change when looking away and then looking back. 
If found uninstalled, the tapestry depicts a scene from wherever it was last installed, and it does not change its scene until it is installed again. 



## VELORIN’S LABORATORY
Wondrous item, rare, requires installation
This elaborate laboratory contains everything a magic-user needs to research new spells. The inks, papers, flasks, pipettes, tinctures, and rare ingredients are worth 10,000 gp and can be packed into two large trunks. When installed in a tower, this laboratory allows the owner to adjust their result up or down by one when rolling on a research chart page 24).


## WHISPERING STONE OF WARNING
Wondrous item, rare, requires installation
You may stare intently at the closed eye carved into this stone and repeatedly whisper a creature type or alignment to the stone for 10 minutes. The stone’s eye opens and displays that name in runic text upon its pupil. If any creature of that type or alignment enters your demesne, the stone whispers to you, warning you of its presence. You can hear this whisper across any distance, but only if you are on the plane as the stone. After a season, the rune begins to fade. You can replace the creature type or alignment the stone warns against by performing the ritual again.

# Armor

## Armor of St . Gaed the Confessor

This set of magic plate mail covered in silver filigree grants +1 Armor Class to the wearer. Also, once per month, the owner can summon the spirits of the Blue Dragon Phalanx to aid them in battle. The Phalanx 
serves for 1 hour or two battles, whichever hap-pens first.The spirits of the Blue Dragonflight will fight your enmies, but if ordered to do anything other than fight 
in a battle against an enemy army, they stand around looking confused, wondering what’s happened to their bodies and the world they once knew.

##Potion of Enhance Ability
Potion, uncommon
Starts as a basic gray potion with no effect. However, 
if a material component is added, it gains one of the 
following effects:
• Potion of Bear’s Endurance. You gain 2d6 temporary hit points and have advantage on Constitution checks for 1 hour. Requires a hair from a bear.
• Potion of Bull’s Strength. You have advantage on Strength checks and your carrying capacity doubles for 1 hour. Requires a tail-hair from a bull.
• Potion of Cat’s Grace. You have advantage on Dexterity checks and do not take damage from falling up to 20 feet while you are not incapaci-tated for 1 hour. Requires a cat’s claw.
• Potion of Eagle’s Splendor. You have advantage on Charisma checks for 1 hour. Requires an eagle’s feather.
• Potion of Fox’s Cunning. You have advantage on Intelligence checks for 1 hour. Requires a fox’s whisker. • Potion of Owl’s Wisdom. You have advantage on Wisdom checks for 1 hour. Requires an m owl’s feather.

# Factions

Disfavor with a faction imposes disadvantage on all Charisma (Persuasion) and Charisma (Intimidate) skill checks made with that faction. In the case of Favors with large groups, you only gain this penalty when interacting with those of high station such as a general, a king, or the patriarch of a patrician family associated with that power.

* You may use a Favor to cancel a Disfavor from the same faction. This voids both the Favor and Disfavor immediately.

* You may spend a Favor with a given faction/group/individual (at GM’s discussion) to gain the benefits of a one-time expenditure of 3 fame with that faction/group/individual. You may spend two favors with the same factionBto gain the benefits of a 5-point fame expenditure.

Важный момент. Члены фракция делятся на регуляров и нерегуляров. Регулярные члены фракции работают за деньги на фракцию и получают урезанные бенефиты. Нерегуляры обладают большей свободой, и в зависимости от ситуации могут даже отказаться от задания.

Конкретная реализация зависит в каждом случае от конкретной игры, мастера, игрока и задания.
Пример. Белдора Арфист в СКТ - регуляр.

Персонажи в Лунном море и приключениях сезонных Лиги - регуляры.

arcanists in Mulmaster—that are sympathetic to
the Harpers’ cause. You have advantage on any
social interaction checks to exonerate you or
anyone in your group for using restricted magic
in and around the city. In addition, you can
spend downtime days to have an arrested caster
freed from prison or harsh punishment. The cost

but parts ways with you after taking part in one
combat or at the end of the adventure.
Emerald Enclave: Secluded Haven
You have a secret place just outside the city
where you and your allies can rest, recuperate,
and find mounts. When you use the recuperating
downtime activity (see the Basic Rules or the
Player’s Handbook), you can apply the effects to
your entire group. In addition, at the beginning of
an adventure or when appropriate, you can
spend downtime days to borrow mounts (riding
horses, ponies, or mules) for yourself and your
group. The cost is 1 downtime day per mount
borrowed. All mounts must be returned at the
end of the adventure. If any mount dies during
the course of the adventure, you must pay half
its value in gold.

You are part of the Hawks, the secret police of
Mulmaster. You maintain law and order through
intimidation and strongarm tactics. You can
coerce information from the common folk for
your benefit, gaining advantage on any
Charisma (Intimidation) checks to do so. Once

adventure secret. The Dungeon Master provides
you with a secret that only you know about the
adventure, and you gain advantage on all
checks to recall related information for the
duration of the adventure.

the ghettos of the city, who are able to procure
restricted and illicit items for you. At the

days to cover this jail time, but you do
not spend your lifestyle costs for these
days. You can avoid jail by paying 50 gp
per day of jail time.
4–6 You are accosted by the city watch
while making the deal. You lose 100 gp
and begin the adventure at half your hit
point maximum, but you manage to
retain possession of the item.
7–12 You find a fence willing to sell you the
item, but it’s going to cost you. Make a
DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check. If
you succeed, you pay 50 gp for the
item. If you fail, you pay 200 gp for the
item.

of your faction-mates in Elventree, you have
learned the secrets of healing the mind. If you
are afflicted with any type of madness, you can
spend one downtime day to reduce your
madness level by 1, and to cure any short-term
madness or long-term madness that afflicts you.

Divine. You are a Whitehawk in the Order of the
Gauntlet, and have been a participant in prayer
circles and rites to combat the demons spilling
from the Underdark. You can spend ten
downtime days to gain an investiture of the
divine that lasts until your next long rest. While
your investiture is active, you can use a bonus
action on each of your turns to grant you or an
ally within 30 feet of you the ability to bypass
damage resistances on the next attack made
against a demon. This benefit does not bypass a
demon’s immunities.

warding areas where demonic madness has
been seen or felt, you and your companions can
bolster your resistance to that madness. For
each downtime day you spend, you can grant
yourself or an ally a madness ward that lasts
until your next long rest. A creature with this
madness ward can use a reaction to gain
advantage on a saving throw against madness.
A character can have only one madness ward
active at a time.

Stingblade of the Lords’ Alliance, dedicated to
helping the common folk stand strong against

Underdark. By spending ten downtime days to
rally the locals—whether surface dwellers or
Underdark denizens—you can call three
bandits (see appendix B of the Monster
Manual) to your assistance. By spending fifteen
downtime days, you can rally three bandits and
one bandit captain to your aid. These allies
perform any tasks within reason and capability,
but they part ways with you after taking part in
one combat or at the end of the adventure,
whichever comes first. If things are looking grim
and you do not already have these allies (and
have not already called them during the current
adventure), you can use a bonus action to
spend an additional five downtime days (for a
total of fifteen or twenty downtime days) and
have these allies immediately show up in a
place of the Dungeon Master’s choosing.
Zhentarim—Opportunist. You are a Viper of
the Zhentarim and are adept at slithering your
way into advantageous positions. Despite the
Red Plumes’ grip on trade in the region and the
chaos spreading as a result of madness in the
Underdark, you are in a perfect position to profit.
While you adventure, you are able collect
valuables without the other party members’
knowledge, then sell those valuables at a later
date. For each ten downtime days you spend
before an adventure, increase your gold rewards
from the adventure by 10 percent, up to a
maximum of 50 percent for that adventure.

Season 3 Rage of Demons/Hillsfar
Rank 3 (Stalwart) Downtime Activities
Members of the five factions who have achieved rank 3 have access to the following special downtime activities when adventuring in and around Hillsfar and in the Underdark beneath the city.
Harpers—Mental Fortitude. You are a
Brightcandle of the Harpers. Under the tutelage of your faction-mates in Elventree, you have learned the secrets of healing the mind. If you are afflicted with any type of madness, you can spend one downtime day to reduce your madness level by 1, and to cure any short-term madness or long-term madness that afflicts you. You can do the same for allies, but the cost is three downtime days per ally cured. You cannot use this benefit to cure indefinite madness, and you cannot reduce your madness level to 0 if you are afflicted with indefinite madness.
Members of the five factions who have achieved rank 3 have access to the following special downtime activities when adventuring in and around Hillsfar and in the Underdark beneath the city.
Order of the Gauntlet—Investiture of the Divine. You are a Whitehawk in the Order of the Gauntlet, and have been a participant in prayer circles and rites to combat the demons spilling from the Underdark. You can spend ten downtime days to gain an investiture of the divine that lasts until your next long rest. While your investiture is active, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to grant you or an ally within 30 feet of you the ability to bypass damage resistances on the next attack made against a demon. This benefit does not bypass a demon's immunities.
Emerald Enclave—Madness Ward. You are an
Autumnreaver of the Emerald Enclave, and know that the madness creeping to the surface world from the depths of the Underdark is wholly unnatural. By performing cleansing rituals and warding areas where demonic madness has been seen or felt, you and your companions can bolster your resistance to that madness. For each downtime day you spend, you can grant yourself or an ally a madness ward that lasts until your next long rest. A creature with this madness ward can use a reaction to gain advantage on a saving throw against madness. A character can have only one madness ward active at a time.
Lords’ Alliance—Rally the Troops. You are a
Stingblade of the Lords' Alliance, dedicated to helping the common folk stand strong against the demonic influences pouring forth from the Underdark. By spending ten downtime days to rally the locals—whether surface dwellers or Underdark denizens—you can call three bandits (see appendix B of the Monster Manual) to your assistance. By spending fifteen downtime days, you can rally three bandits and one bandit captain to your aid. These allies perform any tasks within reason and capability, but they part ways with you after taking part in one combat or at the end of the adventure, whichever comes first. If things are looking grim and you do not already have these allies (and have not already called them during the current adventure), you can use a bonus action to spend an additional five downtime days (for a total of fifteen or twenty downtime days) and have these allies immediately show up in a place of the Dungeon Master's choosing.
Zhentarim—Opportunist. You are a Viper of the Zhentarim and are adept at slithering your way into advantageous positions. Despite the Red Plumes' grip on trade in the region and the chaos spreading as a result of madness in the Underdark, you are in a perfect position to profit. While you adventure, you are able collect valuables without the other party members' knowledge, then sell those valuables at a later date. For each ten downtime days you spend before an adventure, increase your gold rewards from the adventure by 10 percent, up to a maximum of 50 percent for that adventure.
