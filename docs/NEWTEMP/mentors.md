Apprenticeship to MENTOR (Mentor) by APPRENTICE (Apprentice)
Two characters in the FACTION (played by different players), have chosen to enter an Apprentice- Mentor relationship. MENTOR is at least a Mentor and APPRENTICE is of a lower rank, but at least an Agent. 
MENTOR may only have one apprentice at a given time. Similarly, APPRENTICE may only have one Mentor. This relationship persists until the APPRENTICE or MENTOR permanently die, APPRENTICE achieves the same rank as MENTOR, or they decide to part ways (this is generally reserved for players that become inactive or for whatever reason have lost contact with one another). 
Apprentice and Mentor Activities 
Each character in the relationship gains a story award, “Faction Mentor (APPRENTICE)” or “Faction Apprentice (MENTOR)” and is eligible to participate in specific activities. 
Adventure Details. When APPRENTICE and MENTOR bond, they reveal the locations of magic items and FACTION secret missions that they have participated in to each other. There is no additional cost associated with this activity. 
Adventures played with FACTION Secret Missions:

Item Trading. When trading magic items between APPRENTICE and MENTOR, the cost is only 10 downtime days instead of the usual 15.
Fighting Partners. By practicing fighting together before adventures, APPRENTICE and MENTOR can gain complimentary combat abilities. When both APPRENTICE and MENTOR are participating in the same adventuring group (they must be together at the same table, not just in the same Epic) APPRENTICE and MENTOR may spend 5 downtime before the start of the adventure. If they do, they gain the following benefits: 
• Any saving throw made by one participant to save against an effect created by the other is made with advantage. 
• Once per short rest, a participant may use the Help action to assist the other as a bonus action. 
• Neither participant acts as cover against ranged attacks made by the other. 

Apprentice Activities 
Language and Tool Training. APPRENTICE may learn any language or tool proficiency that MENTOR possesses (see below) for 125 downtime (no GP cost).

Word of Advice. MENTOR grants APPRENTICE advantage on one check, save, or attack roll once during an adventure or chapter. This activity costs APPRENTICE 5 downtime days, spent prior to the adventure and declared to the Dungeon Master prior to the start of the adventure. 

Mentor Activities 
Mentorship Renown. When MENTOR takes on a new apprentice, they immediately gain the benefit of a successful Secret Mission for the FACTION. This can only be done once per character. Check the box for this item once it has been completed.
Learn by Teaching. MENTOR gains advantage on one check, save, or attack roll once during a module or hardcover chapter due to reflecting on their prior adventures with APPRENTICE. This activity costs MENTOR 5 downtime days, spent prior to the adventure and declared to the Dungeon Master prior to the start of the adventure. 
Faction Pedagogue. By taking on an apprentice MENTOR becomes approachable to other members of the FACTION who ask their advice. As MENTOR dispenses this advice, they become better known in the FACTION. MENTOR may spend 30 downtime days in exchange for 1 renown. This can only be done once per character. Check the box for this item once it has been completed.
Mentor’s Pride. As APPRENTICE grows in power, their deeds reflect on MENTOR. Each time APPRENTICE gains a level that would put them into a higher tier (levels 5, 11, or 17), MENTOR gains 1 renown. Check off a box for this item every time APPRENTICE advances to a higher tier.
