## Contests

A contest pits two or more characters or creatures against each other, with the outcome determined by each contender’s luck and talent. Contests are a form of ability check, except that instead of matching your roll against a DC, both you and the creature you are opposing make a roll. You then compare the two results to see who succeeds.

When to Have a Contest. Contests arise when two creatures attempt to do the same thing and only one can succeed, such as if both you and a bandit attempt to snatch up a magic ring that has fallen on the floor. In other cases, you might attempt something that another creature actively opposes. If you attempt to push open a door that an orc holds shut from the other side, you make an ability check to open the door, and the orc makes a check to keep it shut.

Resolving a Contest. A contest uses the same rules as an ability check, except that more than one creature makes a check. Any bonuses and penalties you apply when making an ability check that is not a contest also apply to contests involving that ability.
The creature with the higher check result wins the contest. The creature either succeeds at its action or prevents its opponent from succeeding.

If the contest ends in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant might win the contest by default. If you and a bandit tie in a contest to snatch a ring, neither one of you grabs it. If you tie in a contest to push open a door held shut by an orc, the door remains shut.

Likewise, if you tie in a contest to hide from another creature, your situation with respect to that creature does not change. If the creature was already aware of you before the contest, you fail to hide. If it was not aware of you before the contest, you remain hidden.

# DM Guidelines

## Resolving Tasks

In the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS® game, a Dungeon Master must take a number of roles, all at the same time. A DM serves as a referee, interpreting the rules and resolving any conflicts that arise because of them. The DM builds the world, creates adventures, and places monsters and treasure. The DM is the characters’ eyes and ears, describing what the characters can see and hear to the players.

The first rule of being a good DM is to remember that the rules are a tool that you and the players use to have a good time. The rules aren’t in charge. You, the DM, are the one in charge of the game. Guide the play experience and the use of the rules so that as many of your players have a good time as possible. There will be setbacks, such as a character being slain by an unlucky die roll, but look for ways to turn setbacks into interesting complications in the game’s story.

The second rule is to remember that the DM’s power comes with responsibility. Be fair and impartial with the players. Don’t force your story upon them or give them a game where their choices don’t matter. By the same token, challenge their characters with deadly monsters, fiendish traps, and vexing puzzles. A good DM is no pushover, but a good DM is also never simply out to slaughter the characters.

## When to Use Dice

Characters in the D&D game frequently attempt a tremendous variety of tasks, from running across a swinging rope bridge to talking their way out of a sticky spot with an orc chieftain. All these tasks are resolved in an interaction between you (the DM] and the player whose character is attempting the task.

When a player wants to take an action, it’s often appropriate to just let the action succeed. A character doesn’t normally need to make a Dexterity check to walk across an empty room, or a Charisma check to order a mug of ale in a tavern. Only call for a roll if you think it’s worth taking the time for the rules to come into the flow of the game. Ask yourself two questions to aid your decision.
Is the action being taken so easy, so free of stress or conflict, or so appropriate to the situation that there should be no chance of failure? “So easy” should take into account the ability score associated with the intended action. It’s easy for someone with a Strength score of 18 to flip over a table, though not easy for someone with a Strength score of 9.

Is the action being taken so inappropriate or impossible that it would never work? Hitting the moon with an arrow is, for instance, impossible in almost any circumstance.

If the answer to both of these questions is no, some kind of roll is appropriate.

# Exploration

## Hazards

Is there a chance that failing a task might lead to a disastrous outcome for the character? You decide whether a hazard applies to a particular ability check and when the hazard applies.

A hazard might affect a character who fails an ability check. For example, a character who attempts and fails a Strength (Athletics] check to jump across a pit that he or she couldn’t normally clear probably falls into the pit. Sometimes, though, a hazard kicks in only if the character misses the ability check’s DC (or loses a contest] by a significant margin, such as 5 or 10. Examples of hazards can be found in the “Tasks and Skills” section.

### Requirements

A task might require a specific tool or circumstance for a character to have any chance of success. For example, you might need a magnifying glass to accurately appraise a gem.

A character who cannot meet the requirements for a task automatically fails. One who meets them can attempt an ability check as normal for the task.

You can decide to waive this requirement, but the task should be hard to complete without it. You might give the character disadvantage on the ability check, or set the DC higher than you would for a character who met the requirement.

Otherwise, requirements should come up only rarely. Use them to encourage the players to come up with clever solutions, not to punish them for trying to do interesting things.

## Engaging the Players

As a DM, you could memorize these guidelines, apply them flawlessly, and still miss out on the point of D&D. Unlike some other games, D&D is a flexible set of guidelines, not a rigid set of laws.

When you ask a player to make an ability check, an attack, or a saving throw, you first should focus on engaging the players’ imaginations. Describe the scene to them, and pull in details such as sights, sounds, and even smells to make the action vivid.
More important, you want the players to become fully engaged in the game. Reward inventive players who look beyond game options to describe their characters’ actions. Roleplaying games stand out from other types of games because they allow for this type of creativity. Encourage it whenever you can.

The easiest way to do so is to make imaginative solutions the easiest path to success for the adventurers. Consider the following options.

**Ability Checks.** When a player makes an ability check, invite him or her to describe the character’s action. If the player makes clever use of the situation in the description, consider either granting an automatic success or advantage on the ability check.
Contests. In a contest, an ingenious description that points to a key advantage that a character might gain could lead you to grant the character advantage on the check.

**Attacks and Saving Throws.** A colorful description is nice for attacks and saving throws, but should rarely be the avenue to gaining a concrete game benefit, since it is too easy to abuse such an approach. You might have players endlessly describing how they resist a mind flayer’s mind blast or trying to narrate every detail of a sword blow. In most cases, spells and special abilities serve to grant characters advantage on their attacks and saving throws.

That said, if the situation warrants it, use advantage to grant a character an edge.

**Disadvantage.** Not every idea is a good one. A character might try to win the prince’s favor by bragging about all the bandits he or she slew, not realizing that the prince is an avowed pacifist. If an idea backfires on a player, apply disadvantage to the ability check or attack.## Multiple Ability Checks

Sometimes a character fails an ability check and wants to try again. You have a couple of options in this case.

In most cases, the character can simply try again. The only real cost is the time it takes. The character keeps trying and, after enough time passes, eventually succeeds. To speed things up, you can assume that a character can automatically succeed at a task if he or she spends twenty times the normal amount of time needed to complete it. This exception does not allow a character to turn an impossible task into a successful one.

In other cases, the first failure renders subsequent ability checks impossible. For instance, a rogue tries to trick a town guard into thinking that the group members are undercover agents of the king. The rogue loses the contest of Charisma (Deception] against Wisdom. The same lie told again clearly won’t work.

### Dungeon Adventuring


It should come as no surprise that dungeons, subterranean complexes of maze-like passages and chambers, play a key role in DUNGEONS & DRAGONS. Most adventures feature at least one dungeon, and it's possible to set a campaign entirely within an enormous, sprawling dungeon that can take characters from 1st to 20th level.

This section provides a turn-based system for exploring a dungeon. The rules address how to move through and investigate a dungeon, the tasks that characters can undertake while they explore, and how those tasks are performed.

Your Dungeon Map
Before the characters can explore your dungeon, you need to have a map that outlines its key geographic features and terrain.
A dungeon can range in size from a few chambers beneath a ruined temple to a huge complex of rooms and passages that extends hundreds of feet below the earth. It's best to use graph paper to map your dungeon, with each square on the paper representing an area of 10 feet by 10 feet.
You track the characters' movement on your map to determine what sort of obstacles and monsters they encounter. Your adventure notes should indicate the contents of key chambers and passages in the dungeon.
Light. Darkness might be the default condition inside an underground complex, but your dungeon can still have plenty of light sources. Most inhabited areas might be illuminated to some extent; even creatures that can see in the dark still use fire for warmth, cooking, and defense.
 
At the other end of the spectrum, many subterranean creatures, including undead, have no need for light, either because they have darkvision or because they don't rely on sight. In regions where these creatures operate, the characters must bring their own light sources.
Dungeon Features
At its most basic, a dungeon is composed of spaces that are enclosed by walls and separated from one another by doors and other barriers. It has other features, such as traps and portcullises, that further set it apart from aboveground adventuring environments.
Walls. The walls in a dungeon can be thick, natural stone formations or manufactured structures (usually wooden] built to subdivide large chambers.
Walls have hit points and can be destroyed. A creature can break through a 5-foot-square section of wall by succeeding on a Strength check with a DC equal to the wall's current hit points. The hit points and break DC for a section of wall are determined by its material and thickness.
Hit Points/Inch of Thickness
60
5
30
30
10
Doors. Intelligent dungeon inhabitants will barricade or lock doors when possible, especially if they expect attackers. The DC to break down a door depends on the materials used to create it. In addition, characters can attack doors in an attempt to batter them down. The Strength DC to break down a door equals its current hit points.
Door Material Hit Points
Adamantine	120
Glass	5
Iron	60
Stone	60
Wood	10
Portcullis. A portcullis is a set of vertical bars reinforced with one or two horizontal bands of iron. A portcullis is dropped to block a passage, 
with a winch and chain used to raise it back up. The big benefit provided by a portcullis is that it blocks a passage while still allowing guards to watch the area beyond and fire arrows or cast spells into it.
A portcullis can be lifted as an action that requires a DC 20 Strength check, or no check if a character can use that action to turn its winch. A creature that makes a DC 25 Strength check can bend the portcullis’s bars apart to allow creatures to pass through it.
Secret Doors. Some doors in a dungeon are crafted to blend into the walls that surround them. An Intelligence (Search] check is required to find clues pointing to the presence of a secret door. The DC is 10, 20, or 30, with higher DCs denoting better craftsmanship. A secret door that has been detected is treated like a normal door of the appropriate material (usually stone].
Traps. Intelligent dungeon dwellers set traps in areas where they expect enemies to approach, while long-forgotten tombs might have traps set hundreds of years ago.
The Dungeon Turn
This is the sequence of play for a minute of travel and exploration in a dungeon.
1.	Travel Pace and Exploration Tasks. The players decide what direction their characters will move in and their travel pace. They also decide on their exploration tasks, chosen from the list under “Exploration Tasks.” The players should also determine their formation (often called “marching order”]: who is in the front, the middle, and the back of the group.
2.	Progress on the Map. Follow the characters’ path on your dungeon map, describing what they see and allowing them to make decisions as they move. The characters might encounter creatures that you have placed in certain locations. If they do so, an interaction or combat encounter ensues.
3.	Random Encounters. Check for random encounters once every 10 minutes. If monsters are encountered, resolve any interaction or combat that occurs between the creatures and the characters.
After performing these steps, go back to the first step and repeat the sequence for another turn.
