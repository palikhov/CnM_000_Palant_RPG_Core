## Armor Description

**Armor spikes.** Armor spikes can be added to a set of medium or heavy armor for 150 gp, representing the price of the spikes and the expertise needed to add them to a set of armor.

While wearing armor with spikes, wrestling with you is a dangerous proposition. If you use the Attack action to grapple a creature within 5 feet of you and successfully do so, the creature takes 1d4 piercing damage. If the creature ends its turn being grappled by you in this way and is within 5 feet of you, it takes another 1d4 piercing damage. If the suit of armor is magical, the damage dealt by the spikes is also considered magical.


**Banded**. This armor is made of overlapping strips of metal sewn to a backing of leather and chain mail. The strips cover vulnerable areas; the chain mail and leather protect the joints while providing freedom of movement. Straps and buckles distribute the weight evenly, making it easier to move around in this armor. This suit includes a helmet and gauntlets.

**Dragon Leather.** This leather armor is made from the hide of a dragon. It is extremely supple yet far more durable than standard leather armor.
 
**Dragon Scale.** This suit of scale mail is made from a dragon’s scales rather than metal, granting it superior protective capabilities and flexibility.

**Mithral Plate.** This suit of plate is crafted from mithral. It is easy to move in compared to other sorts of metal armor. The dwarves sometimes gift this armor to their most trusted allies.

**Mithral Shirt.** This extremely light chain mail shirt is made of very fine mithral links. The armor is light enough to wear under normal clothing. It is most commonly crafted by elves.

**Armored Coat** Consisting of a short leather jacket reinforced with hidden metal plates, the protective natur of these jackets can be overlooked. Traditionally, they are fitted with hidden pockets and wrist scabbards that can hold a dagger or other small weapon.

This armor can be easily mistaken for normal clothing; any observer must succeed in a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check to recognize the true nature of the armor

**Buckler**: This small shield is fitted around the arm and made of metal, wood, or boiled leather. It takes the same time to don and doff as a normal shield \(1 action\) and a character cannot benefit from a buckler and any other type of shield at the same time. Unlike a shield, a character can still use the hand in which the buckler is equipped. If during a character's turn they use an item with this hand, attack with a weapon in this hand, or attack with a two-handed weapon, then the character does not gain the buckler's bonus to AC until the start of their next turn. Attacking with a one-handed weapon or thrown weapon using the buckler hand causes disadvantage on the attack roll. The hand wielding the buckler does not count as a free hand for the purposes of spellcasting, grappling, or unarmed attacks. A character proficient with shields is also considered proficient with bucklers. A buckler does not benefit from the rules or abilities that specifically refer to shields, such as the Protection Fighting Style or the Shield Master feat.

Targe. This shield is wielded in a way that leaves one’s hand open. While wearing a targe, your Armor Class increases by 1. You can use the hand you wield the targe in to manipulate objects, shove, grapple, or perform somatic spell components.
Creatures that are proficient with regular shields are proficient with targes.




**Tower Shield:** A huge metal-reinforced shield nearly as tall as its wielder. Donning and doffing the tower shield takes 1 action. A character cannot benefit from a tower shield and any other type of shield at the same time. While a tower shield is equipped, its bearer takes disadvantage on all attack rolls due to the off-balancing encumbrance of the shield, unless the weapon has the Light property. A character proficient with both shields and heavy armor is assumed to be proficient with tower shields. All other rules that affect shields still apply to tower shields. Tower shield. While wielding a tower shield, your Armor Class increases by 3, but your speed decreases by 5 feet and you have disadvantage on Dexterity checks and saving throws. You provide three-quarters cover, instead of half cover, to other creatures. You can use your action to set the shield like a wall, giving yourself total cover against ranged attacks until the start of your next turn. Creatures that are proficient with heavy armor are proficient with tower shields.

**Spiked shield:** While wielding a spiked shield, your Armor Class increases by 1. A spiked shield serves as a **martial melee weapon** that deals 1d4 piercing damage. You can use spiked shield as off-hand weapon using standard[2] rules for two-weapon fighting. Characters that are proficient with regular shields are proficient with spiked shields,both as a shield and a weapon.

### Special Weapons

Weapons with special rules are described here.

**Bolas.** A Large or smaller creature hit by a bolas must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or be restrained by it. A creature can break free of the bolas by using its action to make a DC 10 Strength check or by dealing 5 slashing damage to the bolas. Formless creatures are immune to this effect.

**Net.** When you attack with a net, you target a point in space. Each Large or smaller creature within 5 feet of that point must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or be restrained by the net. A creature can break free of the net by using its action to make a DC 10 Strength check or by dealing 5 slashing damage to the net.

**Boomerang.** When you throw this weapon and miss, it returns to your hand. Creatures that are proficient with javelins are also proficient with boomerangs.

**Composite bow.** These bows use a complex design with a high draw weight. You add your Strength modifier alongside your Dexterity modifier to damage rolls for composite bows.

Garrote. When you attack with this weapon and hit, you immediately grapple the target if it is Large or smaller and is not formless. This grapple ends early if you let go of either end of the garrote. While grappled in this way, the creature is gagged, cannot breathe, and melee attacks against it are made with advantage. Rogues are proficient with garrotes.

Kusarigama. This double weapon has very different ends, attached by a chain: a sickle, dealing slashing damage; and a weight, dealing bludgeoning damage with the reach property. You can choose which end with which to attack. Monks are proficient with the kusarigama and can treat it as a monk weapon.

Parrying dagger. When you wield this weapon and are targeted by a melee weapon attack, you can use your reaction to increase your AC by 2 against that attack. Rogues are proficient with parrying daggers.

Repeating crossbows. These crossbows are fitted with cartridges that can hold up to six crossbow bolts. A repeating crossbow automatically reloads after firing until it runs out of ammunition. You can reload the cartridge as an action.

### New Weapon Properties

**Penetrating:** Some ranged weapons are particularly effective against armored opponents at close range. Weapons with the penetrating property grant advantage on attack rolls when used against armored opponents within 15 feet. This ability is ineffective against abilities that increase AC but are not armor such as the monk’s Unarmored Defense.

**Versatile Damage:** Weapons with this quality have both a primary and a secondary damage type. Your weapon will always do the primary damage type unless you declare otherwise before you roll damage.

**Worn:** Worn weapons augment your unarmed attack damage and may not be disarmed. Putting on or removing a worn weapon takes an action.

**Double**:

Double. A double weapon has two ends with which you can attack. When you take the Attack action and attack with the weapon, you can engage in two-weapon fighting with it, treating one end as the required light weapon with the specified damage die.


### New and changed weapons


**Drow War Gauntlet** Created by the dark elves, this wicked implement looks like a leather glove covered with odd protrusions. When a hidden catch is pressed (effectively equivalent to drawing a weapon), twisted blades and spikes spring forth. When you press the catch, you can choose whether you want to deal slashing or piercing damage. The gauntlet continues to deal the type of damage you have chosen until you press the catch to retract the blades. You can’t be disarmed of this weapon by normal means, but when you press the catch and the blades spring forth, you can’t hold anything in the hand upon which you are wearing the gauntlet.

**Two-handed Morningstar** This weapon is simply a larger and heavier version of the standard Morningstar. It is often carried for purposes of sheer intimidation, as it looks wicked indeed.

**Blastpowder and shot (10)** 25 gp per weapon 2 lbs. per weapon

**Cestus:** Popular in the arenas and tavernas of Coryan, this reinforced leather glove consists of a series of leather thongs that are tied over the hand; the thongs secure a set of metal plates, one over the knuckles and the other along the back of the hand. There are two variants of this weapon. The myrmex "limb-piercer" has the versatile damage (piercing) property and the sphairai "bone-breaker" has the versatile damage (slashing) property.

*** On a hit with this weapon, the wielder can forgo dealing damage and attempt to trip the target, in which case the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or fall prone. The DC is 8 + the wielder's Strength modifier + the wielder's proficiency bonus.

**** This weapon is similar to a light crossbow except that it has half the range (40/160 feet) and doesn't have the loading property. It automatically reloads after firing until it runs out of ammunition. Reloading the cartridge takes an action.

***** Can't be bought by player characters. 

### About Worn Weapons

```
You can use weapons you wear on your body, (worn weapons), to make unarmed strikes. When you make an unarmed strike while wearing a worn weapon, you deal the weapon’s damage instead of your normal unarmed strike damage. You must able to use the part of your body where the weapon is attached to make the unarmed strike. You cannot use a cestus to make an unarmed strike if you are using that hand to wield a sword or hold a lantern. For example, when you attack with a cestus, your unarmed strike deals 1d4 + your Strength modifier bludgeoning damage, assuming you use the fist wearing the cestus to make that unarmed strike. 

Worn weapons do allow you to benefit from runes and other magical effects that can be applied to weapons.Any rune or spell that would affect a weapon can be applied to a worn weapon, and the rune or effect applies to your unarmed strikes.

```

**Flintlocks:** Altheria may be a center of knowledge and learning, but it is the power of blastpowder that has kept the Republic of Altheria safe for many years. The Altherians’ advanced understanding of blastpowder and its explosive potential has aided them in the design of their flintlock weapons. 

Altherian flintlocks are designed to take advantage of specific amounts of blastpowder for every shot, leading to the creation of blastpowder rounds – small paper or cloth packets of blastpowder pre-measured to gain the most efficient and accurate shot. Therefore, these fine weapons are usually easier, safer, and faster to reload and fire.

Altherians, as well as clerics and holy champions of Althares, may purchase flintlocks at the listed price and may carry them regardless of rank.

You do not suffer penalties for firing a flintlock while prone. Unless you have a flintlock maintenance kit and are proficient with it, whenever you roll a 1 on a ranged attack roll with a flintlock the weapon malfunctions and jams. A jammed flintlock cannot be fired. 

Repairing a jammed flintlock requires proficient use of a flintlock maintenance kit and takes 10 minutes.

Additionally, in Arcanis flintlocks are reinforced and balanced for use as improvised melee weapons. Flintlock pistols may be used as clubs, while flintlock rifles may be used as greatclubs. If you are proficient with a club or greatclub, you can add your proficiency bonus to attack rolls with your flintlock when you use it as an improvised weapon.

**Arrow, Barbed.** This piece of ammunition causes bleeding wounds. A creature hit with a barbed arrow or bolt takes 1 point of piercing damage at the beginning of its turn until it uses its action to pull the arrow free. Once pulled free of the wound, the ammunition is destroyed.

**Arrow, Smoldering.** This piece of ammunition has a hollow point containing alchemist’s fire and a simple ignition mechanism. A creature you hit with a smoldering arrow or bolt takes 1d4 fire damage at the beginning of its next turn. Once ignited, the ammunition is destroyed.

**Arrow, Smoking.** This piece of ammunition lets out a blast of smoke on contact. A 5-foot radius sphere centered on the creature or point you hit is heavily obscured until the end of your next turn. Once ignited, the ammunition is destroyed.
**Arrow, Splintering.** When you hit a creature with a splintering arrow or bolt, it explodes into wooden or bone shards. Each creature within 5 feet of the target must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 piercing damage. Once it explodes, the ammunition is destroyed.
Smoke pellet. As an action or bonus action, you can throw a smoke pellet at a point within 10 feet of you. The smoke pellet then detonates and is destroyed, creating a 10-foot cube filled with smoke. This area is heavily obscured until the end of your next turn.
**Smokestick.** As an action, you can ignite a smokestick using a torch, tinderbox, or other source of fire or intense heat. Once ignited, the smokestick continually fills the area within 5 f eet of it with thick, black smoke. An area filled with the smoke is heavily obscured. This smoke disperses at the end of your next turn, but the smokestick continues to burn for 1 minute, allowing it to be thrown or moved around with to form large areas of smoke.
**Tanglefoot bag.** As an action, you can throw this bag of alchemic goo at a creature within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged attack against a creature, treating the bag as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the creature is restrained for 1 minute if it is Large or smaller. Hit or miss, the tanglefoot bag is then destroyed. A creature restrained by the goo can free itself by using its action to make a DC 13 Strength check or by dealing 10 points of slashing damage to the goo. The goo has an AC of 13. In either case, the effect ends early.
**Thunderstone.** As an action, you can throw a thunderstone up to 30 feet. When it strikes a hard surface or is struck hard, it creates a deafening bang and is destroyed. Creatures within 10 feet of the stone must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be deafened for 1 hour. If a creature deafened in this way casts a spell with verbal components, it must make a DC 11 Charisma saving throw or fail to cast the spell.
**Tindertwig.** You can strike the end of this small, wooden stick on a flammable object, requiring no action. The object immediately ignites and the tindertwig is destroyed.

**Acid.** A glass vial of acid holds 4 ounces. As an action, you can splash the contents of the vial onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw the vial up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a target creature or object. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 acid damage. If poured on metal, the metal takes 1d4 acid damage at the start of each of your turns for 1d4 rounds.

**Adventurer's Kit.** This pack has the basics that an adventurer needs to get along in the wilderness. The kit includes a backpack loaded with a healer's kit, a mess kit, a tinderbox, ten torches, ten days of rations, and a waterskin. In addition, 50 feet of hempen rope are strapped to the pack.

**Alchemist's Fire.** This sticky, adhesive fluid ignites when exposed to air. A clay flask of alchemist's fire contains 1 pint. As an action, you can throw the flask up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a target creature or object. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 11 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.

Farming Tools. In this bag is a collapsible hoe, a collapsible rake, a book of known herbs and their farming techniques, and a small satchel of seeds worth 3 gp.
If a character wishes to tend to their own garden or plant seeds, it would be appropriate to ask for a Wisdom check, where as tiying to identify a plant with their book may use an Intelligence check. If a character would try to gather leaves in a pile quickly, it wouldn't be uncommon to ask for a Dexterity check, while trying to clear thick roots might be a Strength check.
Prospector's Kit. In this metal box is a collapsible hammer used to breaking small rocks, a gold pan, a tiny magnifying glass, a handful of brushes, and a scraping tool.
It would be common to ask for a Dexterity check when trying to properly scrap clay or rock off of a surface, whereas it might be suitable for a Wisdom check to pick out the fine flakes of gold An Intelligence check might be called for identifying the difference between silver and Sham Silver.
Taxidermist's Kit. This container holds a set of leather punches, a fine knife for scraping, a pair of small shears, and needles.
A Strength check would be suitable for attempting to gather the tough scales of a dragon, where as a Dexterity check might be more preferable for softer hides. A Charisma check might be asked in order to make a beautiful taxidermized creature for a patron.


Parachute. This parachute is more of a small glider, rather than a widespread cloth. The frame is made of a sturdy metal, which has loops that hold the fabric.

### Optional Rule: Large Weapons and Armor

```

There are some Heroes who are naturally Large size, or who have the ability to increase their size and become Large.

If this occurs, you may be required to purchase weapons and armor sized for a Large creature.

Finding someone with the skill to forge Large-sized equipment is no easy task, and the equipment itself costs double its listed price. Large weapons deal an extra die of damage, so a Large longsword deals 2d8 damage. You cannot wear armor that is too small for you.

If you try to wield a weapon too big for you, you suffer disadvantage on all attack rolls with that weapon, even if you are proficient with it. If you wear armor that is too big for you, you suffer disadvantage on all Dexterity (Stealth) checks and your speed is reduced by 10, no matter your Strength.

The nordmansch make more axes than their woodsmen actually need. The nordmansch greataxe is a two-handed weapon built to sunder other weapons. Its edge is hardened especially for this purpose, and its haft is likewise set with trapping prongs to catch and hold a foe’s weapon. At the GM’s discretion, typical greataxes may also use the sundering strike maneuver. 

**Sundering Strike.** As part of the attack action, make a single attack roll with your nordmansch against a creature wielding a weapon, including natural weapons. If the attack hits, the weapon is damaged, and all attacks made with this weapon have disadvantage. Another sundering strike destroys the weapon.

### NORTHLANDS ESTOC

A hand-and-a-half sword designed to pierce heavy armor and sharpened only on the tip, an estoc is 4 feet long, sometimes with a second crossguard. It is said to have been used first by the knights ofVaelTurog and Balinor against the elves, but now is used by dwarven mercenaries and human knights who expect to fight other heavily armored warriors. Its anti-armor properties make it popular with monster hunters and dragon slayers as well. Sometimes called the “tuck.” The estoc also has the following special property. Special: The estoc deals an additional id6 damage to creatures wearing heavy armor, or naturally armored creatures with an AC of 16 or higher. 

**Armor-Piercing Thrust.** As an action, you may pinpoint a weak point of an opponent’s armor and make a single attack with your estoc against it. This attack pierces armor, treating the target’s AC as io + their Dexterity modifier. On a hit, this attack does normal weapon damage, and does not deal the additional damage granted by the estoc’s special property \(above\). 

**Blunted Bash**. Instead of dealing piercing damage, you can choose to deal bludgeoning damage by striking the target with the estoc’s unsharpened blade. This attack’s damage die is one size smaller than normal \(id4 if one-handed, id6 if two-handed\), and cannot benefit from the estoc’s special property \(below\).

### ROTHENIAN PONIARD

This longsword has a spring-loaded poniard concealed in the hilt, which quickly extends when the hilt is gripped in a particular way. It is particularly beloved by rogues, as the concealed blade helps them sneak attack opponents already locked in combat. Kariv of a crueler bent have been known to poison the secondary blade. Thanks to its hidden blade, the Rothenian poniard has the following special ability: 

> **Special:** The larger blade is a versatile weapon, and the secondary blade is a light weapon. You may make an attack with the secondary blade as bonus action, as if you were two-weapon fighting. Retracting the poniard requires an action.

**Hidden Poniard.** If the poniard is still concealed within your sword’s hilt, you may make a Dexterity \(Sleight of Hand\) check opposed by a target creature’s Wisdom \(Perception\) check. If you win this contest, you may make a single attack roll with the concealed poniard against that target. This attack has advantage. 

## SOUTHLANDS WEAPONS

### DIKAMA \(FANG BLADE\)

First crafted by the bronzesmiths of the Lion Kingdom of Omphaya, the wicked dikama fang blade is shaped like a serrated, oversized lion’s tooth. 

**Bloody Wound.** When you hit a living creature with a dikama, you can choose to make a superficial but bloody wound. The attack deals no damage, but the target takes id6 slashing damage at the beginning of each of its turns until it or another creature makes a DC 10 Wisdom \(Medicine\) check as an action to stop the bleeding or until it receives magical healing. 

**Serrated Twist.** When you deal damage to a living creature with a dikama \(not including damage from the Bloody Wound maneuver\), you may twist the serrated blade as a bonus action. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw or take 2d4 slashing damage.

Armor: A suit of scale or plate made from fervidite may look dull, but it is much lighter than a similar suit made of a different metal. Fervidite armor removes disadvantage of Dexterity (Stealth) checks and any Strength requirement to move at full speed caused by the armor. Additionally,

Medium fervidite armor can be worn under clothing, requiring an observer to succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check to spot the armor.

Weapon: Weapons and ammunition made from fervidite have 50 extra hit points and are considered to be  both adamantine and silver for the purpose of bypassing damage resistances and immunities, or triggering damage vulnerabilities. Fervidite can be used to either forge the blade of a weapon like a sword or it can be used to add studs and tracings to a weapon like a quarterstaff.

Due to the strength of the metal, ammunition made from fervidite generally does not break when fired. At the end of combat, you can recover all expended ammunition made from fervidite, unless the GM says otherwise. 



Armor: While you are wearing a suit of adamantine armor, anytime you are hit with a critical strike the attack becomes a normal hit and the armor takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to AC. Adamantine armor reduced to AC 10 is destroyed. Some smiths can repair adamantine armor, but the process is expensive and time consuming. Usually, it costs half the total purchase cost to repair adamantine armor.

Weapon: Weapons made of adamantine are virtually unbreakable and have resistance to all slashing, piercing, and bludgeoning damage. Some creatures, usually constructs, have resistances that can only be bypassed by adamantine weapons.

## Elixir of the Valinor’s Heart

Potion, very rare

Description: This ornate crystal vial contains a viscous red fluid.

History: Said to have been created by the val’Mehan family during the ancient Blood Wars, the formula for creating this potion was discovered by the Emerald Society during an expedition in the Blessed Lands. Since creating one draught of this elixir requires the complete exsanguination of a val, it was considered too dangerous for public consumption and so consigned to the Vaults of Forbidden Knowledge in New Althre’. Nevertheless, the formula made its way into grimoires of various black sorcerers, witches and unscrupulous Sarishans across the Known Lands.

Abilities/Effects: This elixir grants the drinker the bloodline abilities of a single val family, with the specific powers being dictated by which val was used to create the elixir. For 1 hour after imbibing this elixir, you gain one of the following benefits as appropriate:

If you are a val of a different bloodline from the elixir, you suppress your own powers and replace them with powers chosen from the potion’s bloodline. You may only access a number of bloodline powers equal to those you already have (for example, if you have 3 val bloodline powers presently, you may only access 3 bloodline powers of equivalent level of the val bloodline of the elixir).

If you are not a val you gain no benefits from this elixir, and instead suffer 4d10 poison damage and are poisoned for 1 hour.

Potion, uncommon

Description: This milky mixture is usually contained in a metal flask, which bubbles and sizzles when unstopped.

History: First gaining popularity in the gladiatorial arenas of Sicaris, Eppion, and Plexus, the elixir was a closely guarded secret as use of magical or alchemical enhancements are frowned upon. It remained so until the funerary games of the Emperor Calcestus val’Assante. There, a second-rate gladiator butchered a very skilled and favorite fighter of the new emperor. After an investigation, the gladiator confessed to taking the concoction and soon thereafter use of the fury elixir has been prohibited. Even though the elixir blesses the user with greatly enhanced physical attributes and the ability to ignore pain, it later ravages the mind and body leaving many a gladiator an empty husk.

History: Believed known only to the Beltinian high priests for use in their most sacred rituals travelers to the Hinterlands have witnessed the Ehtzara use a similar potion to achieve the same results. Scholars are unsure if this is merely a product of parallel development or if there is some heretofore unknown link between the Beltinians and these erratic shamans.

The tribe’s witch doctor prepares the draught from sacred peppers, a fresh kill and invocations to the spirit of the fearsome striped hunter that stalks the land. Though savage, the Nung do understand and appreciate the strange and exotic trinkets that come from trade. Far ranging Chauni and Dailish pirates have managed to acquire the recipe and have sold it to alchemists and scholars across the Known Lands.

Abilities/Effects: When you drink this magical potion your hands become muscular and paw-like with retractable claws. For the next hour, your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 slashing damage. In addition, when taking the Attack action, you may make an additional unarmed strike as a bonus action.

What some imbibers feel is even worse is that prince’s flower is only found upon the Isle of Tears, the home of the dreaded Sorcerer-King and his Harvesters. Originally created by the Ymandrake Wine Drinkers, they often demand payment in the form of information on the whereabouts of arcane spellcasters in exchange for another vial.

#### Oil of Beast Repulsion

Potion, rare

Description: This murky liquid has an unexpectedly floral scent, and is applied topically. If ingested, it acts as a mild poison, inducing violent vomiting for ld4 hours.

#### Oil of Deflection

Potion, rare

Description: Stored in a hinged shell of a small turtle, this salve is created from a mixture of herbs and a pungent mold that grows deep within swamps and marshes. Rumors persist of additional, if less savory, ingredients but what these are is something that the ss’ressen priestesses are unwilling to share. After letting the concoction cool after boiling, it creates a smelly paste that is applied by smearing it over the user’s body.

O#### il of Scent Masking

Potion, uncommon

Description: This amber colored oil is odorless. When applied, this oil masks the scent of the wearer.

History: This oil was first discovered being used by poachers raiding the preserves of Balantica to avoid the hounds and other beasts used to safeguard the area. When questioned, the poachers couldn’t identify who sold them the oil. The ruling val’Dellenov family believes that it must have been the neighboring val’Borda family, testing the oil’s efficacy before issuing it to their spies. For their part, the scions of Cadic vehemently deny any such accusations.

Abilities/Effects: After spreading this oil upon your body, any creature who attempts to track or locate you though scent suffers disadvantage on their ability checks for the next three hours.

After hurriedly preparing his first vial of it, he presented it to Order. Needless to say, his superiors were most pleased and Adkir’s worth to the Wine Drinkers soared.

Only accomplished Wine Drinkers are allowed access to the lesser bloodmastery potion and the secret of its creation, while only the highest-ranking Wine Drinkers have access to the greater bloodmastery potion.

So commonplace were these sacred oils that the soldiers began to irreverently calling it, “the Gods’ spit”.

Her party of explorers came across the deserted encampment of a tribe of savage Voei. While the rest of the expedition sifted for rare Voei artifacts, Calyce stumbled upon the dwelling of the tribe’s witchdoctor. Among the many strange items in the hut, she came across a sample of a strange salve. When applied to the skin, the flesh becomes hard and warty, taking on a brown tinge and making it resistant to many types of harm.

After years of experimentation mostly on herself, Calyce was able to replicate the recipe and manufacture more of the paste.

## Mastercraft Items 

A mastercraft item is an item created with such skill and care that it is clearly superior to a normal item. Not just any craftsmen can create a mastercraft item; only an expert in his or her craft, with exceptional skill and years of experience, can create such an item. Mastercraft items can take the form of weapons, armor, or tools. All mastercraft items are exceptionally durable and can take wear and tear better than a normal item. Although mastercraft items are not magical, magic items are mastercraft items, but their magical description and properties replaces any benefit they grant from being mastercraft.

Mastercraft weapons are particularly sharp and sturdy. You gain a +1 bonus to damage rolls made with a mastercraft weapon. Your weapon is less likely to break under normal use. Ammunition generally cannot be mastercrafted. If a mastercraft weapon gains a bonus to damage from any other source, that bonus replaces the bonus granted from the weapon being a mastercraft weapon. Mastercraft weapons cost 300 GPs more than the base price of the weapon. A mastercraft weapon can also be silvered, but this costs an additional 100 GPs. 

### Mastercraft Armor 

Mastercraft armor and shields provide the same protection as their normal counterparts but weigh less. Mastercraft light armor, medium armor, and shields weigh half as much as normal.

**Hides & Leathers Dragon Leather: Armor \(leather, studded leather, scale mail, hide\):** The powerful virtues of dragon's hide can be invested into suits of armor made of the material by cunning craftsmen. When you're wearing armor made from it, you reduce the damage taken from slashing and piercing injuries by 1. You additionally reduce damage taken from a single damage type that corresponds with the original dragon's breath weapon by 1 \(fire for red dragons, lightning for blue, etc\). Wearers are warned, however, that dragons do take ill to those they encounter wearing this. Metals Adamantine: An alloy of adamant, silver, and electrum, or of steel and mithral, it is black in color, with a green sheen in candlelight or a purple-white light in magical radiance. 

**Armor \(Chain shirt, scale mail, breastplate, half plate; ring mail, chain mail, splint, plate\):** Adamant makes armor of exquisite diamond-hard substance. While you're wearing it, any critical hit against you becomes a normal hit. Weapons: Though adamantine weapons have no additional properties, adamantine takes and holds magic quite well. Many magical weapons are wrought of adamantine because of this. 

**Adamant:** A gleaming, glossy black refinement of adamantine, a natural jet-black ferromagnetic ore found in obsidian beds. It is gleaming, glossy black, with a rainbow sheen in bright light. It is too brittle to make keen weapons from, but is a favorite of dwarf-folk for hammers. **Armor \(Chain shirt, scale mail, ring mail, chain mail, splint\):** Though this jet black metal is too fragile to form actual armor, strips of it can be used to reinforce flexible armors. It strengthens the armor minutely, but its main property is to partially absorb fire. You reduce all slashing damage by 1, and all fire damage by 1d6. In any combat in which you take bludgeoning damage, however, roll a d20 at the end of the combat. If you roll a 9 or lower, the strips of adamant have been shattered and will need to be repaired **\(which costs 20% of the cost to install the reinforcements\)** by a smith skilled in the working of adamant. Until repairs are done, you lose all benefits of this material. Weapons **\(bludgeoning\):** When you have advantage on an attack roll, if the lower of the two dice would also hit your target's AC, you inflict an additional d4 damage. 

**Arandur:** Once the exclusive secret of the gnome-kind, arandur is a gleaming silver-blue metal, with a green reflective sheen in sunlight. It also naturally absorbs the magical injuries used to inflict raw kinetic injuries. **Armor \(scale mail, breastplate, half plate; splint, plate; shield\):** When used to make non-flexible metal armors, arandur grants its wearer the ability to reduce force damage by 2. Weapons **\(slashing or piercing\):** Arandur can be honed to wicked edges that are not easily dulled. When you inflict a critical with a slashing or piercing weapons wrought of arandur, add your Proficiency bonus to the final damage total. 

**Darksteel:** A silvery metal with a shadowed cast that gleams purple-ish in firelight, darksteel's making is lost today, an ancient secret of teh Ironstar clan of dwarves. Smiths throughout the Realms offer great amounts of gold for the recovery of any lost ingots of the metal. **Armor \(Chain shirt, scale mail, breastplate, half plate; ring mail, chain mail, splint, plate\):** Armor wrought of darksteel reduces all bludgeoning and lightning damage inflicted to the wearer by 1. 

**Dlarun:** A little known halfling metal dug up from clumps of river clay and then kilned at high temperatures, dlarun is a bone-white metal that can take a high polish, and gains a distinctive greenish sheen under magical lighting. It has the strange benefit of steadying the minds of those that wear it. **Armor \(Studded leather; breastplate, half plate; splint, plate; shield\):** Armor wrought of dlarun reduces all bludgeoning and psychic damage by 1, and grants a +1 to saves against all Enchantment spells. 

**Gold:** Though quite precious, gold is still considered one of the "common metals." Gold is aligned with solar and celestial magics, purifying undeath. Gold continually flakes and chips away, however, necessitating constant **\(although simple\) repairs. Armor \(any\):** Though gold is too soft to make armor from, while wearing gold-filigreed armor, reduce all necrotic damage taken by 1. For each item of armor possessed and used, add the following costs to your Lifestyle expenditures per month: 1sp for light armor or shield, 5sp for medium armor, 1gp for heavy armor. **Weapon \(any\):** Gold-filigreed weapons used to strike the undead inflict 1 additional point of radiant damage. For each such weapon, add 2sp to your Lifestyle cost expenditures per month.

**Mithral:** Called the "truemetal" by dwarf-folk, mithral is derived from soft, glittering, silvery-black ore found in rare veins and pockets from the depths of the Underdark to surface rocks. 
**Armor \(chain shirt, scale mail, breastplate, half plate; ring mail, chain mail, splint, plate; shield\):** Mithral lends subtlety and grace to the wearer. If the armor normally inflicts disadvantage on Stealth rolls, that property is negated. If it does not, then the armor can be worn normally under clothes without giving away the fact that the wearer is wearing armor. **Weapons \(slashing or piercing\):** The fine edge of mithral is sung about in elven ballads, and with good reason. When you have advantage on an attack roll, if the lower of the two dice would also hit your target's AC, you inflict an additional d4 damage. 

**Silver:** Another common metal, silver is aligned with the powers and mysteries of Selûne. **Weapon \(any\):** Many creatures take grievous wounds from silvered weapons. Though the metal is too soft and costly to make weapons from directly, weapons can easily be silvered with the stuff, granting the property of the metal without taking away from its utility. 

**Telstang:** Originally a gnomish secret, this alloy of copper, mithral, platinum, and silver is a dull pewter-silver in hue, and gives off a clear bell-like tone when struck with another metal \(leading to its other name of "singing metal"\). It also collects and reverberates sudden sonic assaults outward away from itself. **Armor \(Scale mail, breastplate, half plate; splint, plate\):** Though telstang's construction make it largely unsuitable for armors, some craft them anyway for its two tremendous benefits. The first is that any sonic damage taken by the wearer is reduced by 1d6 points. The second is that the wearer automatically succeeds at any saving throws that paralyze or change his shape. Any critical hit with bludgeoning or force damage shatters your armor, however \(though this critical hit only inflicts normal damage instead of doubling it\). Metal Treatments These are alchemical and metallurgical treatments used to treat specific kinds of metals.

**Blueshine:** Metal weapons and armor. A treatment that gives a bluish sheen to any items wrought of iron, steel, adamantine, arandur, darksteel, mithral, silver, or telstang, blueshine helps negate caustic substances. The metal part of weapons coated in the stuff become immune to acid damage, and armors coated in it grant resistance to acid damage: reduce all acid damage taken by 1 for medium armors or 2 for heavy armors. 

**Everbright:** Metal weapons and armor. A dwarven process now known to smiths of many folk, everbright-treated items gleam with a mirror finish \(like a chromium finish\). Metal objects \(which can only be made of steel, adamantine, or mithral\) treated with everbright are immune to rust and the passage of time, and those wearing armor or bearing shields treated with it reduce radiant damage taken by 1 for medium armors and shields or 2 for heavy armors. Remaining unseen while wearing such armor is quite difficult, however; those searching visually for everbright-clad characters gain advantage on their checks to spot them. Halabar's Stealth: Metal weapons and armor. An expensive but increasingly common metal treatment that renders metallic weapons and armor nonferromagnetic, nonreflective, and wholly silent, not even clanging when struck against other metals or stone. Drawing or wielding such weapons will not reveal a hidden character, and metal armor wrought of it does not inflict disadvantage on Stealth checks.

# Снаряжение для Паладина

Паладины крайне серьезно относятся к своему снаряжению, и всегда стараются купить самое лучшее. Своим снаряжением они не только подчеркивают  честь своего положения; для некоторых  снаряжение символизирует их принципы.

• Щит символизирует клятву паладина придерживаться своего этоса. 

• Меч символизирует тех кого он поклялся защищать: одна грань аристократию, вторая обычных людей.

• Доспехи являются символом его отношения к власти. Как доспехи защищает его тело, так же он должен защищать своего монарха.

• Шлем олицетворяет собой его религию. Так же как шлем защищает его голову, так же он должен защищать свою церковь.

• Одежда, хорошей выделки и безупречно чистая, символизирует чистоту духа.

## Стандартное Снаряжение

Вещи из следующего списка имеют почти все паладины. Обычно, эти вещи приобретаются из лишних денег паладина. Обычно паладины стараются поддерживать свои вещи в идеальном состоянии, следовательно, они редко требуют замены.

### Доспехи

Паладину доступны все виды доспехов. При наличии выбора, более предпочтителен полный латный доспехи. Но, из-за дороговизны полного латного или простого латного доспехов, некоторые останавливаются на пластинчатом или плетеном доспехе, или даже кольчуге. Кожаный, клепаный кожаный и набивной, включая магические, обычно игнорируются, поскольку эти доспехи обычно ассоциируются с людьми более низкого класса. Паладин скорее предпочтет обычную кольчугу, чем клепаную кожу +3.

В большинстве миров  паладин предпочитают следующий набор доспехов: хаубрек/шлем (или то и другое вместе), кольчуга и латный доспей.

Хаубрек и шлем. Небогатые паладины, обычно из примитивных государств, или же те, кто только начинает свою карьеру, обычно носят только хаубрек (часть кольчуги, закрывающая грудь) и шлем. Обычно паладин сам делает хаубрек, наматывая проволоку вокруг палки, затем, отрезая куски, так что бы получились кольца. Затем он выравнивает их при помощи молота, затем заклепывает их вместе, так что бы они приняли форму тела, по длине до колен и с капюшоном накрывающим голову. Шлем обычно заостряющийся к верху и с открытым лицом. Комбинация хаубрека и шлема гораздо дешевле, чем кольчуги, но и имеет АС 7.

Кольчуга. Хаубрек вместе с кольчужными леггинсами и защитой для рук составляет кольчугу (AC 5). На шлеме также можно добавить козырек для лучшей защиты лица. Несмотря на то, что кольчуга относительно недорога и сравнительно легка, у нее так же есть свои недостатки. Во-первых, вес очень неравномерно распределяется по телу и ложится в основном на плечи. И даже самый сильный человек устанет, если будет целый день, не снимая носить кольчугу. Мастер так же может назначить штраф -2 ко всем броскам атаки этого человека (если он больше 24 часов не снимая, носит кольчугу).

Хотя бы раз в неделю, кольчугу надо смазывать маслом и полировать, процесс этот занимает часа 3-4.  Если за ней не ухаживать, то через месяц она придет в негодность, АС будет ухудшаться на один за каждый месяц без надлежащего ухода.

Латный доспех. Латы (AC 3) включает в себя нагрудник, наспинник, и полоски металла на ноги и на руки, в общем, на те места, которые не защищает кольчуга. Листы металла называющиеся pauldrons защищают места между руками и грудью. Эпольеты (наплечники) защищают верх туловища; латные рукавицы (металлические перчатки) защищают руки.

Высокоуровневые паладины иногда украшают свои латы (латные перчатки, шлемы) золотыми или серебряными украшениями или небольшими бриллиантами. Эти вещи совместимы с этосом паладина, который должен по своему статусу производить хорошее впечатление, но не может копить и афишировать богатства. Геральдические символы могут быть выгравированы или нарисованы на любых местах латного доспеха.

Латный доспех тоже должен полироваться и смазываться маслом, но поскольку он состоит из более крупных частей, нежели колечки у кольчуги, то он меньше подвержен ржавлению. Хотя латный доспех заметно тяжелее кольчужного, но его вес лучше распределяется по телу, за счет чего люди носящие его меньше устают.

### Щиты

Большинство паладинов используют средний щит, поскольку он предоставляет хорошую фронтальную и боковую защиту и достаточно легок, для того чтобы использовать его верхом. Обычно они сделаны из дерева и обтянуты толстой кожей, имеют треугольную форму с округлой вершиной и заостренными нижними углами. Сам щит выпуклый и размером примерно 4 - 5 футов. Паладин держит его в левой руке (или правой, если он левша) за специальную ручку, которая находится с внутренней стороны щита.

Некоторые паладины предпочитают прямоугольные, круглые или даже пятиугольные щиты. Щит может быть отделан золотом, серебром, бриллиантами, на нем могут быть выгравированы геральдические знаки или же он просто может быть ярко раскрашен.

### Оружие

Хотя паладин может владеть любым оружием, но большинство чувствуют себя неуютно без меча (длинного, двуручного, полуторного, а может быть даже и короткого), копья (среднего или тяжелого) и кинжала. Обычно паладин носит свой меч в ножнах на поясе, в этом случае с другой стороны висит кинжал.

Так же паладины могут иметь следующие оружия цеп всадника, булава всадника, пика всадника, боевой топор и скимитар. К метательному оружию паладины равнодушны, так как оно тяжело в использовании, если ты на коне.

Турнирное копье, хотя и предпочтительно, обычно очень дорого. За место этого, паладин может на наконечник обычного копья надеть деревянную заглушку и тем самым сделать его пригодным для турниров. Заглушка же эта может оказаться ненадежной; есть 5% шанс, в течение поединка, (1 на 1d20), что она отвалиться. В этом случае поединок приостанавливается и начинается заново.  Боец, постоянно теряющий заглушку для копья, может быть дисквалифицирован.

### Одежда и Специальные Предметы 

Выбирая одежду, паладин пытается объединить в ней функциональность и элегантность. Он предпочитает яркие, насыщенные цвета (синий, красный, зеленый, фиолетовый) и, когда может себе это позволить, дорогую ткань (шелк, вельвет). Поскольку паладина часто встречают по внешнему виду, трата денег на дорогую одежду и снаряжение не считается нарушением этоса.

Идеальный гардероб, который паладин приобретает в течение своей карьеры, состоит из следующих вещей:

• Две строгие шелковые или льняные рубашки с длинными рукавами.

• Две пары бриджей или брюк, плотно облегающих ноги, сделанных из шерсти, хлопка или льна, (брюки широкого покроя обычно ассоциируются с крестьянами или низкими по статусу людьми). Бриджи обычно до колен и ярко раскрашены.

• Подкладка к доспехам (из мягкой кожи или подбитой ткани, носимая под кольчугой, что бы предотвратить натирание.

• Две пары шелковых носков.

• Пара сапог для верховой езды.

• Пара кожаных туфель, обычно, заостренных к носу  и застегивающихся на щиколотке.

• Две туники, длиной до колена и надевающихся через голову, обычно без рукавов. Туники могут быть украшены рисунками или же драгоценностями.

• Накидка, так же без рукавов. Накидка обычно окаймлена мехом, со всякими кисточками, ленточками.

• Легкая мантия для весны и лета, из хлопка или шелка, застегивающаяся на горле при помощи застежки.

• Зимняя мантия подбитая бобровым, лисьим или другим теплым мехом.

• Широкий кожаный ремень, с железной пряжкой.

• Шерстяная хлопковая или фетровая шапка.

• Церемониальный чепец (плотно сидящая шапка, закрывающая волосы и уши, подвязанная под подбородком) из льна или шелка, украшенная вышивками, перьями или золотыми нитями. Обычно он нужен для правительственных банкетов или церковных церемоний. Женщина паладины используют церемониальный платок.

• Два хлопковых или шерстяных полотенца (одно для умывания, второй в роли скатерти).

• Столовые приборы: вилки, ложки, ножи, чашки, тарелки, бокалы. Эти вещи должны быть из серебра, золота, хрусталя.

• Полное снаряжение для своей лошади.

• Два теплых одеяла, одно для себя, второе для лошади.

• Зеркало (необходимо для ухода за лошадью).

### Формальная Одежда Для Паладинов Женщин

Женщины паладины могут носить всю вышеперечисленную одежду. Для формальных церемоний, женщины паладины могут носить, тунику до пола, называемую килт (kirtle), которая плотно облегает грудь, бедра и ноги. Женщины также носят чулки, на подвязках, а вот обувь для всех одинакова. 

## Эмблемы, Штандарты и Навершия

Паладины часто украшают свои доспехи, щиты, одежду или оружия надписями или символами которые символизируют их ранг, церковь или короля. За определенные поступки церковь или монарх могут преподнести в дар паладину какие-либо украшения, которые будут свидетельствовать о его поступках:

Эмблема. Эмблемы символизируют родину паладина, его семью или Орден. Эмблема может быть как медальоном, подвязкой, так же это может быть гравировка на доспехах, щите, оружии или вышивка на одежде. Обычные символы: люди со звериными головами, цветок или дерево с короной,  оружие с крыльями.

Штандарт. Штандарт это флаг с  Y-видной верхушкой, на длинном древке. Штандарт может  включать в себя набор цветов, геральдические символы или знаки различия церкви или правительства паладина. Штандарт становится знаменем,  когда его обрезают так, чтобы он стал квадратным. Небольшой штандарт, называется флажок и может прикрепляться на копье.

Навершие. Навершием может сложить пучок кожаных полосок, несколько перьев, деревянная резьба, кисточка или любой другой маленький предмет прикрепленный к шлему паладина. Навершие обычно того же цвета, что и щит паладина. Обычно их одевают на турниры, что бы можно было отличить одного паладина от другого,  но некоторые паладины носят их всегда. Навершие так же можно надевать на гриву или уздечку боевой лошади.

## Дополнительное Снаряжение

Священное писание. В священном писании записаны все постулаты веры персонажа, молитвы, принципы поведения, требования со стороны божества, а также другой теологический материал. Священное писание не является книгой заклинаний и никак не помогает при их сотворении.

Поскольку священное писание может быть очень дорогим, персонажи иногда просят церковь предоставить им его  в рассрочку, добавляя по несколько золотых монет к своей обычной десятине, но если церковь богата, то она может безвозмездно предоставить своему паладину священное писание. Но в этом случае если паладин теряет книгу, то он обязан выплатить ее стоимость церкви.

Герб. Обычно это относится к геральдическим рисункам на щитах или доспехах паладина, но иногда может означать определенный тип одежды, например, белая туника, носимая поверх доспехов, украшенная геральдическими символами паладина. Такая туника, во-первых, дает возможность другим понять, кто стоит перед ними, а во-вторых, может спасти от перегревания в очень жаркую погоду.

Косметический набор. Очень полезен при подготовке к какому-либо официальному приему или банкету, косметический набор обычно содержит: кусок овечьего жира, что бы сделать кожу блестящей, румяна, сделать щеки белыми или розовыми, тальк для тела с легким, приятным запахом, а так же приспособления для бритья.

Набор для ухода за лошадью. Для эффективного и полного ухода за лошадью, этот набор включает в себя скребок (для отряхивания  грязи с шерсти),  бритва (для срезания лишних волос), губка для тела (для удаления грязи с ног, копыт и других мест, где не подходит скребок), щипцы (доставлять камни застрявшие в копытах), и расческу для гривы и хвоста (чтобы очистить и расчесать волосы).

Похожие наборы существуют для всех видов животных.

Султан. Представляет из себя пучок связанных перьев, ленточек, кисточек, переплетенных с тонкими металлическими проволоками. Султаны прикрепляется на шлем (возможно, по бокам), края щитов, защищая глаза от яркого света. Так же они несколько замедляют коррозию и помогают отражать удары.  Обычно они раскрашены в те же цвета, что и щит паладина. 

Саше. Небольшая сумочка, в которой хранятся смеси цветков, трав  специй, которые придают приятный запах одежде. Саше может, хранится где угодно.

Шпоры. Со шпорами значительно легче управлять своей лошадью, так как есть возможность отдавать команды легким движением ноги. Лучшие шпоры те, которые не причиняют боли животному, они имеют колесики определенной формы, за место острых концов.

## Новое Магическое Снаряжение

**Сбруя полета:** Сбруя полета похожа на обычную сбрую, для лошади, слона или любого другого спутника. Когда  надета на спутника паладина,  сбруя полета может, по команде паладина, выращивать металлические крылья, длиной примерно в две длины спутника. Эти крылья позволяют спутнику летать со скоростью его обычного передвижения и иметь класс Маневренности С. Естественно животное, одетое в эту сбрую, может летать так, как если бы умело летать всегда.

Паладин, который не владеет профессией Воздушной Верховой Езды, получает штраф -2 к своим броскам атаки и должен делать проверку Ловкости тогда, когда скажет Мастер, персонаж владеющий этой профессией никаких неудобств не испытывает.

Крылья держатся 1d4 часа в день; спутник инстинктивно чувствует, что время полета подходит к концу и всегда успевает вовремя приземлиться.

**Уздечка спокойствия:** Эта уздечка, когда надета на спутника паладина, позволяет ему избегать всех эффектов магического страха. Что касаемо морали,  уздечка спокойствия делает бесстрашным  спутника паладина (мораль 19-20). Ее можно использовать как на спутниках, так и на обычных животных.

**Султан призывания:** Когда находится на шлеме паладина, султан призывания позволяет ему телепатически призвать своего спутника, на расстоянии 10 миль на уровень. Если спутник попал в плен, или по каким то другим причинам не способен вернуться к паладину, он чуствует тупую боль вокруг глаз, как бы то ни было, паладин не может узнать точного местонахождения спутника.

**Масло гармонии:** Если этим маслом полностью смазать любой металлический доспех, то его АС улучшается на 1 на 24 часа.   AC не может стать меньше 0. Процесс смазывания доспеха занимает 1-2 часа, в зависимости от его размеров.

**Ножны сохранности:** Меньше фута длиной, эти кожаные ножны, казалось бы, подходят только для кинжала. Но, на самом деле, в них убирается любое оружие любого размера (от ножа до алебарды). Когда часть оружия попадает в ножны, оно все уменьшается до размеров кинжала. Оружие можно достать только при помощи кодового слова или заклинания удар (knock). После того как оружие полностью вынули из ножен, оно принимает свои обычные размеры.

**Мешочек десятины:** Это небольшой кошель из черного вельвета, перевязанный шелковой веревочкой. Любые монеты, драгоценные камни, все, что в него попадает, сразу переносится в церковь паладина, либо туда кому он должен отдавать десятину. Для этого необходимо иметь камешек, кусочек дерева, все что угодно, что связано с местом назначения. В противном случае его можно использовать, как просто кошель, но он может быть использован только законопослушно добрыми персонажами.

**Туника комфорта:** Эта легкая туника может быть одета поверх кольчуги, либо поверх любого доспеха, чей вес не равномерно распределяется по телу. Она идеально распределяет вес, за счет чего доспех начинает весить в два раза меньше, а персонаж не подвергается эффектам усталости.
