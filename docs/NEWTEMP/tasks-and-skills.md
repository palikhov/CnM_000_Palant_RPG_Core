## Strength

### Athletic
You might make a Strength (Athletics] check in difficult situations encountered while climbing, jumping, or swimming. Here are examples:

* You attempt to climb a sheer or slippery cliff, avoid hazards while scaling a wall, or cling to a surface while something is trying to knock you off.
* You try to jump an unusually long distance or pull off a stunt midjump.
* You struggle to swim or stay afloat in treacherous currents, storm-tossed waves, or areas of thick seaweed. Or another creature tries to push or pull you underwater or otherwise interfere with your swimming.

Check DC|Climbing Examples|Jumping Examples|Swimming Examples
---------|----------|-----------|-----------
5|Climbing a steep hill or slope.|Making your normal jump distance with a running start.|Swimming through calm waters.
10|Climbing a tree or a steep, rough incline.|Jumping 5 feet further or 2 feet higher than normal with a running start, or avoiding a low ceiling or waist-high obstacle during a long jump.|Swimming through rough waters.
15|Climbing a tall pole or totem, or dungeon- or ruin-style stone walls.|Jumping your long jump distance without a running start, or jumping 10 feet further or 4 feet higher than normal with a running start.|Swimming through stormy waters.
20|Climbing a brick wall or rock cliff.|Jumping 15 feet further or 6 feet higher than normal with a running start.|Swimming up a fast- moving river.
25|Climbing a tall, sheer cliff, or a wall made of shaped stone.|Jumping twice your normal jump distance with a running start.|Swim through a giant whirlpool.
30|Climbing a wall of force.|Jumping twice your normal jump distance without a running start, or three times as much with a running start.|Swimming up a waterfall.
The DC for a given climbing example increases by 5 if the surface is slick with liquid but decreases by 5 if you have decent handholds or a properly-secured rope.

Climbing, jumping, and swimming should remain purely in the playhouse of Strength. Dexterity and the Acrobatics skill should not be applied to these given activities, to keep Strength a relevant, obvious solution to problems these can solve.


Climbing. Scaling an incline is an easy task that should not require an ability check, even a steep one given generous handholds. Failure should not mean a deadly fall. A Dexterity saving throw of a lesser DC can sometimes be allowed to stay in place. In most cases, failing simply causes one to slide back down unless under immediate duress and threat of injury.

Calling for a check at all is only really required if the situation is appropriately dangerous. An entire party could scale a steep cliff without much effort, so long as there is nothing nipping at their heels or waiting at the top for them.

Jumping. The Athletics skill states that it can be used to jump unusually long distances. Only call for such a check if a character could not make it with their default jumping distance, detailed in the rules for movement.

## Dexterity

### Acrobatics

Make a Dexterity (Acrobatics] check to balance when you try to keep your feet in a tricky situation, such as when you’re trying to run across a sheet of ice, balance on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking ship’s deck. The DM might also call for a Dexterity (Acrobatics] check to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.

Acrobatics is not a replacement for the Athletics skill. Instead, it has very specific implementations that are usually done passively or as part of some other action: keeping one’s balance, slipping out of tight spaces, and of course performing acrobatic stunts.

ACROBATICS DCS

Check DC | Situation
---------|----------
5|Walk in a straight line with your arms out to either side.
10|Keep one's footing on an icy surface in combat.
15|Perform a standing backflip, or walk across a tightrope.
20|Perform a quadruple somersault during a jump.
25|Cartwheel across a tightrope.
30|Walk across a frictionless surface.

### Sleight of Hand

Whenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting something on someone else or concealing an object on your person, make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand] check. You can also draw small weapons without alerting anyone that you have done so, such as when palming a knife or sliding darts out of your sleeve. And the DM might call for a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand] check to determine whether you can lift a coin purse off another person or slip something out of another person’s pocket.

This skill could, in many ways, simply be combined with the Stealth skill. However, it still does have its uses and can come up in play, if not all that often. This will mostly occur through the Steal action, but Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks can be used for pulling magic tricks or carefully manipulating small objects.

Like the Stealth skill, Sleight of Hand is almost always opposed by a creature’s Wisdom (Perception) check or passive Perception score, with almost no exceptions. A soft DC 10 can be used to perform some simple acts of manual trickery, such as using a fishhook and line to grab a set of keys from a jail cell.

### Stealth

Make a Dexterity (Stealth] check when you attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on someone without being seen or heard.

Stealth is perhaps the most well-defined skill in Dungeons & Dragons. It is used for anything involving stealth, and it is always contested by a creature’s Wisdom (Perception) check or passive Perception score.

To smooth play, do not call for repeated Dexterity (Stealth) checks when a character is simply moving through an area. Instead, only ask for another check if the character is spotted or performs a specific action that could break their stealth. A Dexterity (Stealth) check of 17 could get a creature past most guards and sentries, even passing across doorways or moving within a few feet of an unaware guard. However, once a character attempts to take out a guard or after a character activates a trap, a second check may be worthwhile, as the situation can change dramatically.

### Other

The DM might call for a Dexterity check when you try to accomplish one of these tasks:
* Keep a trap from functioning
* Control a heavily laden cart on a steep descent
* Steer a chariot around a tight turn or obstacle
* Pick a lock
* Stay in the saddle of a rearing horse
* Securely tie up a prisoner
* Wriggle free of bonds

## Constitution

Constitution checks are uncommon, because the endurance this ability represents is largely passive rather than involving a specific effort on the part of a creature. A Constitution check can model a creature’s attempt to push beyond normal limits, however. No skills apply to Constitution checks.
The DM might call for a Constitution check when a character tries to accomplish one of these tasks:
* Hold his or her breath
* March for hours without rest
* Go without sleep
* Survive without food or water
* Quaff an entire stein of ale in one go
* Roll down a steep slope without taking damage

## Intelligence

An Intelligence check comes into play when a creature needs to draw on logic, education, memory, or deductive reasoning. The Arcana, History, Nature, Religion, and Search skills apply to some Intelligence checks.

During the course of an adventure, players may encounter things that their characters may know about, but which they do not. Doing this makes heavy use of Intelligence- based skills (Arcana, History, Nature, and Religion especially).

Usually these checks are made without much trouble. When a player wants to know about a creature during combat, however, combat can be slowed down. To make a check to recall information about a creature, an object, or anything else, a character must use their action or reaction to do so.
A check to identify a creature and its general strengths has a DC of 10 + half the creature’s CR. This increases by 5 if the creature is not from the Material Plane. Succeeding by 5 or more also recalls some or all of the creature’s specific abilities and weaknesses.

### Arcana

A character might make an Intelligence (Arcana) check to recall lore about spells, magic items, eldritch symbols, magical traditions, the planes of existence, or the inhabitants of those planes.

The Arcana skill is not just for recalling information about magic, identifying spells and such. It can be used to figure out how a magical device functions, or to disable magical traps. Given the nature of Dungeons & Dragons’ settings, the Arcana skill should have plenty of instances to shine.

Arcana is also the most versatile knowledge skill when it comes to monsters. It can be used to recall information about the abilities of most aberrations, celestials, most constructs, elementals, fey, fiends, monstrosities created by magic, some oozes, and most undead, as Arcana covers knowledge about spells, magic, and the planes all in one.

ARCANA DCS

Check DC | Situation
---------|----------
Varies	| Identify a spell, either as it's being cast or by its effects (DC 10 + the spell's level).
5	|Recognize that an effect is magical.
10	|Determine whether a creature or object is magical in origin, and recall information about it if it's common.
15	|Recognize the type of magic of an effect (whether it's of arcane, divine, psionic, or some other type of origin). Recall the common inhabitants of another plane of existence, or recognize the influence of another plane on an area.
20	|Recall information related to a legendary item or artifact's origin and powers, or about the state and effects of another plane of existence.

### History

A character might make an Intelligence (History] check to recall lore about historical events, legendary people, ancient kingdoms, past disputes, recent wars, or lost civilizations.

Unlike Arcana, History is dedicated almost entirely to recalling information. Its use is quite specific as well. In a pinch, the skill can be used past its normal intentions to recall information about the local region, such as local nobles, recent battles, and local feuds or problems.
It can also be used to recall information about particularly impactful monsters. Information about dragons, giants, and humanoids tends to fit best in the History skill. Depending on the setting, it may help recall information about other monsters, such as the role of aberrations in Eberron.

Check DC | Situation
---------|----------
5	|Recall common information about the recent past.
10	|Recall uncommon information about events in the last 5 years.
15	|Recall hidden information about the last century.
20	|Recall hidden information about the last millennium, or information about something purposely destroyed or wiped from most historical records.
25	|Recall hidden information about the distant past, so long as it was recorded in some way.
30	|Recall, in perfect detail, any event from the distant past.


### Nature

A character might make an Intelligence (Nature] check to recall lore about terrain, plants and animals, the weather, or natural cycles.

Nature is one of the wider Intelligence skills, usable in a host of situations, especially to recall information about beasts, the wilder dragons, many fey, primal humanoids, common monstrosities, and of course plants.

In some cases, Wisdom (Nature) checks may be appropriate. Consider allowing these for rangers and druids, who are close to nature but whose Intelligence scores are generally not all that high.

NATURE DC

Check DC | Situation
---------|----------
5	|Identify common plants and animals.
10	|Recall that a neighboring desert is infamous for its ice storms, or that the local forest is guarded by vengeful fey.
15	|Determine that a storm is artificial, that a cliff face is actually an unnatural façade, or that a specific animal usually isn't found in the area.
20	|Identify that a creature is one-of-a- kind or possibly a new species.
25	|Pinpoint the depth and epicenter of an earthquake from eyewitness reports.
30	|Determine that a nearby mountain is going to erupt within the next few days.

### Religion

A character might make an Intelligence (Religion] #check to recall lore about deities, rites and prayers, ecclesiastical hierarchies, holy symbols, or the practices of secret cults.

Religion is the narrowest of the Intelligence skills. DMs coming from older editions often use it beyond its stated scope, though this has little impact on the game itself. In truth, Intelligence (Religion) checks may rarely come up in a game not involved with cults or religious organizations.

That’s not to say it’s completely useless. It can be used to recall information on many celestials, fiends, and some undead, as they relate to cults and deities.

RELIGION DCS

Check DC | Situation
---------|----------
5| Recognize holy symbols of common deities.
10| Recall the rites and major traditions of common religions, enough to fit in at a church.
15|Determine which deity or cult an ancient ruin was dedicated to, or recall information on local mythology.
20|Recognize the secret symbols and actions of cultists hiding their dealings in plain sight.
25|Recognize the symbols and myths of a god dead and buried for 10,000 years.
30|Improvise the proper rites of a long- dead religion to contact its sleeping god.

### Invvestigation

When you look around for clues that point to a hidden object, such as a trap or secret door, or hints of a creature’s passage through an area, you make an Intelligence (Search] check.

This skill is the “black sheep” of the fifth edition skill system. Often confused with Perception in its use, the difference between the two is often vague, both in rules and in various official adventures.

The best way to illustrate this is with a common Dungeons & Dragon element: traps. Perception can be used to spot a trap. You can see the shine of torchlight on a tripwire, or the slight separation between stones indicating a pressure plate. Investigation allows you to figure out how a trap works. It lets you notice that the trip wire is likely attached something that comes down from the slots in the ceiling, or that the pressure plate likely has to do with the holes in the walls.

It may also be better to think about them in terms of scale. Perception is for things that are obvious, out in the open. You could notice them at a glance, given a high enough awareness. Investigation is for seeing smaller-scale things, such as that a single book in a bookcase is out of place, with a different subject than the others.

Like Insight, Investigation can be used by DMs to move a campaign along. If players have found clues but aren’t connecting them, an Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Investigation) check may help them put 2 and 2 together.

INVESTIGATION DCS
Check DC | Situation
---------|----------
5|Notice that one person in a lineup is of a different race than the others.
10|Determine the weakest pillar holding up an aging ruin's ceiling, or notice that one person in a crowd has a limp.
15|Determine that a letter contains a secret message, or pour over a text and find a specific passage quickly.
20|Find the single brick in a wall that, when pushed, opens a secret door.
25|Spot a secret message hidden in the specific wording of an ancient text.
30|Find a needle in a haystack.

### Other

The DM might call for an Intelligence check when a character tries to accomplish one of these tasks:

* Communicate with a creature without words
* deduce what kind of weapon caused an injury
* Estimate the value of a precious item
* Pull together a disguise to help an ally pass as a city guard
* Determine how to cause part of a tunnel to collapse
* Pass off a forged document as real

## Wisdom

### Animal Handling

When there is any question whether you can calm down a domesticated animal, keep your mount from getting spooked, or intuit an animal’s intentions, make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check.

Animal Handling sees perhaps the least use in most campaigns. If someone takes it, try to give them a few chances to use it, even if it’s only once or twice every few sessions.
 
ANIMAL HANDLING DCS
Check DC | Situation
---------|----------
5	|Command a healthy, trained animal to do a trick it knows.
10	|Command a healthy, trained animal to do a trick it doesn't know, or to put itself in harm's way.
15	|Get an untrained animal to do what you want, for its benefit.
20	|Get an untrained animal to attack an enemy or otherwise put itself in harm's way.
25	|Get an injured and untrained animal to put itself in harm's way.
30	|Command a cat to bark.

If the check is made under external threats, such as during combat or while avoiding an ongoing lava flow, increase the DC by 5. Having something the animal wants (especially food) can give a character advantage on the check.

### Perception

You might make a Wisdom (Perception] check to spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. For example, you might try to hear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, or hear creatures moving stealthily toward you in the forest. Or you might try to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, whether they are orcs lying in ambush ahead of you on a road, thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed secret door.

Being one of the most-used skills, Perception needs little encouragement in its use. Perception is also the one skill focused on for passive scores. For NPCs, passive Perception use is a must to speed up play, but for characters, encouraging regular active use of the Perception skill can keep play active. While some say to use passive Perception as a hard minimum for Wisdom (Perception) checks, it can be useful to completely ignore it for active checks where failure could be more interesting, exciting, or dangerous.

PERCEPTION DCS

Check DC | Situation
---------|----------
5	|Hear people talking in the next room, or see someone walking in the trees.
10	|Hear people whispering in the next room.
15	|Read the lips of someone across the room.
20	|Hear and understand whispers from a room over, or see the telltale signs of a secret door.
25	|Hear an owl gliding in for a kill.
30	|See the outline of an invisible creature.

### Insight

When you attempt to determine the true intentions of another person, such as when searching out a lie or predicting someone’s next move, you can make a Wisdom (Insight] check. Doing so involves gleaning clues from body language, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.

Insight is yet another skill used in contests more often than flat checks. Unlike NPCs, PCs do not get situational bonuses to their Wisdom (Insight) checks, instead relying on the player’s own wit. However, in a pinch with no leads, a character can make a DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check to get a hunch that something is amiss or not. If the DM so decides, he or she may provide the player with some sort of hint to go along with the hunch, such as “People’s eyes keep glancing at the beautiful tapestry on the far wall” to denote that people might be hiding something.

On a failed check to notice an NPC’s bluff, the DM should be careful not to show their hand. Too often, even a failed check can tell the player that their suspicions are at least partially correct, instead of revealing little or no information. When describing a failure to detect a bluff, try to say that a character has trouble getting a good read on the NPC, rather than saying that the character finds the NPC trustworthy.

### Survival

A character might make a Wisdom (Survival] check to hunt wild game, guide a party safely through frozen wastelands, identify signs that owlbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards.

Survival is yet another well-defined skill. The guidelines in the Dungeon Master’s Guide on foraging, navigation, and tracking all give solid DCs on the skill’s use.

When cook’s utensils aren’t available (or a character isn’t proficient in with them), Wisdom (Survival) checks can be used to determine if a proper meal is prepared by an unskilled chef. A DC of 10 is usually more than enough to produce something edible from wild game and plants, with a 15 or 20 giving a much-needed morale boost in the wilderness in the form of a delicious, if gamey, meal. This morale boost can be presented by temporary hit points, usually 1d4.

### Medicine

When you try to stabilize a dying companion or quickly diagnose what common illness is afflicting him or her, you make a Wisdom (Medicine] check.

Yet another underused skill, Medicine can have more uses than just stabilizing a dying ally in combat. Medicine can be used in place of other Intelligence-based checks to recall information and determine the nature of poisons and diseases, especially when they are affecting a creature. In many cases, Intelligence (Medicine) checks are even more apt than Wisdom (Medicine) checks, though medicine in D&D is often based on gut-feelings rather than the modern method of rote learning.

MEDICINE DCS
Check DC | Situation
---------|----------
5	| Determine that someone has a cold. Recall how to treat common ailments.
10	|Identify fresh wounds and determine how they were made in most cases.
15	|Determine the exact cause of death of the recently deceased. Determine how to treat a rare poison or disease.
20	|Identify a specific poison or disease by only cursory descriptions or symptoms.
25	|Find the cure or treatment for a magical disease.
30	|Raise a creature that has recently died not through magic but your skill alone.

### Other Wisdom Checks

The DM might call for a Wisdom check when a character tries to accomplish one of these tasks:

* Figure out the direction to a source of moving air while underground

* Discern whether a seemingly dead or living creature is undead
  
* Sense the true direction of an echoing sound

## Charisma

Charisma checks and their corresponding skills can be a point of contention. Firstly, they are not a replacement for roleplaying—trying to get one’s point across and interacting with an NPC should be a precursor to any Charisma check in situations that are not simply handwaved during shopping, downtime, or other bookkeeping tasks.

Charisma checks are often better treated as a way to see how a situation pans out, in a more meta sense. A 
high Charisma (Persuasion) check, even with poor reasoning beforehand, can simply show that an NPC is willing to give the character the benefit of the doubt. A poor Charisma (Intimidation) roll, even if the odds are stacked against the NPC, may reveal that the NPC has a sudden boost of morale from a secret plan he or she has. And a poor Charisma (Deception) check, even if what the PC said is totally believable, may show that the NPC is simply a suspicious type who has a nose for danger.
In this way, Charisma can be seen not just as force of will in a direct sense, but a type of social luck—the ability for things to go well for a player character. After all, luck is an important skill to have as an adventurer.

Charisma checks with NPCs are usually contested by Wisdom (Insight) checks. To avoid undue rolling and putting the need for luck on the players’ shoulders, it is usually best to use the NPC’s passive Insight score. Depending on the situation and the actions of the character, this score can be modified. Use the Insight Modifiers table as a guideline. Try to limit the modifiers to 2 or less: one for the NPC’s attitude toward the character, and another for the situation.

### Persuassion

When you attempt to influence someone or a group of people with your tact, social graces, or good nature, make a Charisma (Persuasion] check. Typically, you attempt to persuade someone when you are acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of persuading others include convincing a chamberlain to let you see the king, negotiating peace between warring tribes, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.

The last of the three major Charisma skills, Persuasion is also the most-used. Influencing an NPC to do what you want is an important skill to have! As such, it is often opposed by an NPC’s passive Insight score, with adjustments based on the attitude of the NPC as given in the Insight Modifiers table in the previous section.

In this case, using the Insight score might not make sense, at first. Just like Intimidation, consider the Insight score as a way to represent not only the ability to detect lies but a sort of luck created by situational awareness. A creature with a large bonus to Wisdom (Insight) checks is more likely to foresee negative outcomes to doing what the party wants or even associating with them.

The DM should try to only call for Charisma (Persuasion) checks when the NPC in question wouldn’t perform or refuse to perform the action in question. A close ally may already give their life for the party, but a villain will surely reject any requests the party makes that don’t fit their fell fancy.

Finally, the Persuasion skill can be used to handwave the gathering of rumors. Searching for information or rumors on a specific subject in a town might take a few hours and a DC 10 or 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check, allowing characters to move the story forward while others shop or rest.

### Deception

When you make a Charisma (Deception] check, you are attempting to deceive someone, either verbally or through your actions, which can encompass everything from misleading others through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fast-talk a guard, con a merchant, earn money through gambling, pass off a disguise, dull someone’s suspicions with false assurances, or maintain a straight face while telling a blatant lie.

Due to its situational nature, Deception is usually used in contests alone, opposed by an NPC’s Wisdom (Insight) check. Generally, it’s best to use passive Insight scores to set a DC for the check, with adjustments based on the attitude of the NPC. Insight in this case is used in its closest rules-as-written form, allowing an NPC to detect whether a PC is pulling their leg.

The Insight Modifiers table in the previous section contains guidelines for modifying an NPC’s Insight score to set a DC for a character’s Charisma (Deception) checks.


### Intimidation

When you attempt to influence someone through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical violence, make a Charisma (Intimidation] check. Examples of when you would intimidate another include trying to pry information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs to back down from a confrontation, or using the edge of a broken bottle to convince a sneering vizier to reconsider a decision.

Like Deception, Intimidation is often contested by a Wisdom (Insight) check or, more smoothly, an NPC’s passive Insight score. The Insight Modifiers table in the previous section contains guidelines for modifying an NPC’s Insight score to set a DC for a character’s Charisma (Intimidation) checks.

Many players attempt to use this skill in combat. While tempting, the DM should not use the frightened condition in this case, as it steps on the toes of many class features and spells. Instead, use Intimidation checks as a way to affect morale. A high Intimidation check accompanied by the slaying an opponent may cause weaker enemies to retreat. A low Intimidation check may make stronger enemies more aggressive. In either case, the Insight skill is used to represent not just a creature’s ability to read a situation but also to show their self-awareness, whether they can avoid being overcome by fear in the heat of battle or not.


### Performance

You make a Charisma (Performance] check to perform before an audience with music, dance, acting, legerdemain, storytelling, or some other form of entertainment.

### Other Charisma Checks

The DM might call for a Charisma check when a character tries to accomplish one of these tasks:
* Find the best person to talk to for news, rumors, and gossip
* Blend into a crowd to get the sense of key topics of conversation

## Hazards
Is there a chance that failing a task might lead to a disastrous outcome for the character? You decide whether a hazard applies to a particular ability check and when the hazard applies.

A hazard might affect a character who fails an ability check. For example, a character who attempts and fails a Strength (Athletics] check to jump across a pit that he or she couldn’t normally clear probably falls into the pit. Sometimes, though, a hazard kicks in only if the character misses the ability check’s DC (or loses a contest] by a significant margin, such as 5 or 10. 

## Requirements

A task might require a specific tool or circumstance for a character to have any chance of success. For example, you might need a magnifying glass to accurately appraise a gem.

A character who cannot meet the requirements for a task automatically fails. One who meets them can attempt an ability check as normal for the task.

## Synergy bonuses

Some tool proficiencies can give synergy bonus to specific skill use - granting advantage or negating disadvantage.

## Disguise Kit

## Расширенное описание Stealth

When a creature tries to hide, it relies on its Dexterity to remain unnoticed. A creature can attempt a Dexterity (Stealth] check to sneak around, moving quietly and using cover and heavily obscured areas to avoid detection.

There are two ways you can hide. If a creature can’t possibly see you, you need only to avoid making noise to avoid detection. If a creature might see you, you need to keep behind cover or stay in heavily obscured areas to remain hidden.

When you try to hide from one or more creatures, your Dexterity (Stealth] check is contested by the Wisdom (Perception] check of any creature who might notice you or the Intelligence (Search] check of a creature that is actively searching for signs of your presence.
You make one Dexterity (Stealth] check for this contest. Use that check result for all such contests you engage in until you are discovered or you stop hiding.

### Conditions for Stealth

In order to avoid detection, you need some way to remain out of sight, either something to hide behind or an area of poor visibility to locate yourself in.

Stay out of sight. You can’t just stand in the middle of an empty, lit room and hope to avoid notice. Something must conceal you, perhaps a large object, a piece of terrain, or an immobile creature of a sufficient size, such as a slumbering dragon. Regardless of what stands between you and a viewer, it must cover at least half your body for you to hide behind it.

An environmental phenomenon that obscures you from view can also provide a means to hide.

A heavily obscured area typically contains darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage. A creature in a heavily obscured area is out of sight, just as it if were hiding behind an obstruction, and thus can try to hide. A lightly obscured area typically contains dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage. Some monsters and characters have special abilities that enable them to try to hide even in areas that are only lightly obscured.

Stay quiet. It's assumed that you try to avoid making noise while hiding, and your Dexterity (Stealth] check also represents your ability to keep quiet. If you make a noise, such as yelling a warning to an ally or knocking over a vase, you give away your position and are thus no longer hidden.

### Benefit of Being Hidden

You have advantage on the attack roll when you attack a creature from which you are hidden. Making an attack reveals your position, however.

## Расширенное описание Perception. Отличие от Investigation

As you move through a dungeon, walk along a forest trail, or search a sage's sanctum, you rely on your abilities to spot hidden clues, notice lurking monsters, find traps or secret doors, and avoid unpleasant surprises. The DM describes the scene to you, but sometimes you want your character to search for something that the DM might be omitting from the description. The perception rules help determine whether your character notices or can find a hidden object or creature.

### Noticing and Finding

Your Wisdom (Perception] check serves as a measure of your general awareness of your surroundings, whether you notice creatures lurking in ambush, hear the stealthy tread of an approaching assassin, or catch the telltale whiff of troglodyte in the air.

Your Intelligence (Investigation] check measures your ability to find something you're looking for, whether it’s the faint outline of a secret door in a wall, the hollow sound that reveals a hidden compartment in the bottom of a chest, clues to a murder, or the footsteps of an invisible creature in the dust.

Sherlock Holmes, renowned for his Intelligence, is the undisputed master of finding clues and determining their significance (using the Investigation skill]. Tarzan, on the other hand, who unfailingly hears the rustle of leaves or the snap of a twig, or sees a stalking tiger or lurking snake, relies on his Wisdom (Perception).

The line between using Wisdom or Intelligence can seem indistinct at times. Making an effort to notice something might seem similar to finding something you’re looking for, but it still relies on Wisdom (Perception], because it’s more about general awareness than it is about attention to detail. Likewise, if you spend a moment to scan the surrounding trees, or press your ear to a door to hear what might lurk beyond, you’re relying on Wisdom (Perception] rather than Intelligence (Investigation]. 

**As a rule, if you’re not positive that Intelligence is the right choice, then Wisdom is the ability to use.**

### Finding a Hidden Object

When your character searches for a hidden object, such as a secret door or a trap, the DM typically asks you to make an Intelligence (Search] check. Such a check can be used to find hidden details or other information and clues that you might otherwise overlook. The DM sets the DC, as usual.

In most cases, you need to tell the DM where you are looking in order for him or her to determine your chance of success. For example, a key is hidden beneath a set of folded clothes in the top drawer of a bureau. If you tell the DM that you pace around the room, looking at the walls and furniture for clues, you have no chance of finding the key, regardless of your Intelligence (Search] check result. You would have to specify that you were opening the drawers or searching the bureau in order to have any chance of success.

Since traps and other dangers might protect hidden objects, this attention to detail is important for the game to remain fair. Just as the DM should never dictate your character’s actions, so too should you make your intentions clear to the DM when you search for concealed clues and hidden treasures.

### Noticing or Finding a Hidden Creature

When a creature is hiding from your character, you contest that creature’s Dexterity (Stealth] check with either a Wisdom (Perception] check

or an Intelligence (Investigation] check. The DM usually asks you for a Wisdom (Perception] check if you have no idea that a creature is present and thus no reason to be actively searching, or if you're taking a moment to scan your surroundings or listen for movement. In this case, your search is a mix of looking and listening, so you don't normally need to be too specific in your description of where you're searching. A lurking foe might give itself away with a muffled cough, a trail of disturbed dust, or some other sign.

The DM generally asks for an Intelligence (Investigation] check if you’re specifically searching for clues to a hidden creature’s location. Here the guidelines for finding a hidden object apply; you need to tell the DM if you’re looking at the curtains for a telltale bulge, checking the floor for footprints, or taking some other action to find the creature.

### Listening at a Door

As your character explores a dungeon or a similar environment, one way to be prepared for dangers ahead is to press your ear to a door in an effort to hear signs of activity beyond. If humanoid creatures are occupying the area, you might hear the casual conversation of bored sentries or a fierce argument between two rival chieftains. If a dragon is sleeping on its treasure pile, you might hear the rhythmic whisper of its breathing, perhaps punctuated by fiery snorts or the crackle of electricity around its nostrils.

When you listen at a door or otherwise try to hear noise in an area, the DM asks you to make a Wisdom (Perception] check, setting the DC based on the volume of whatever you might hear.

# Правила по социальным взаимодействиям - Social Interactions

Exploring dungeons, overcoming obstacles, and slaying monsters are key parts of most D&D adventures, but no less important are the interactions that adventurers have with other people, monsters, and even things in the world. Nonplayer characters might serve as patrons who send the adventurers on quests and reward them for their efforts, as allies who offer them material aid to help them accomplish their goals, as companions who accompany them on their adventures, as obstacles to achieving what they desire, and as adversaries in a social or political arena. Some monsters are open to negotiation when adventurers stumble into their lairs, perhaps granting the heroes their lives in exchange for great piles of treasure or the promise of better food elsewhere. Even dungeon features such as talking statues or magic mirrors can play an important role.

There are several schools of thought when it comes to handling interactions in a roleplaying game. Some players and DMs prefer to speak in character and adopt the mannerisms of their characters in the same way that an actor plays a role on stage. Others prefer to describe a character’s dialogue, giving a basic outline of what the character has to say. Neither approach is necessarily “correct,” and the approach you take has no impact on the rules for resolving interaction situations.

An interaction should always be driven by the back-and-forth between an NPC and the adventurers. No rules are necessary when the adventurers ask an innkeeper for directions or purchase a new coil of rope, and the DM might not even require the characters to play out these routine interactions. Roleplaying is important in important situations, and dice should come into play only when there is uncertainty about a conversation’s outcome. When the adventurers interrogate a captive orc, it might reveal the location of its lair or it might stay silent, even in the face of death. The characters’ words and actions, and their die rolls, help determine the orc’s response.

## Attitudes and Reactions

The starting point for an interaction encounter is the attitude of the NPCs or monsters involved. A creature’s attitude toward the adventurers determines how it acts and how it reacts when they make some request or demand of it.

During the course of an interaction, the adventurers may make requests or demands, and the Dungeon Master may ask for a Charisma check to influence that character. The results of the check are limited by the character’s attitude.

Note that simply rolling badly on a Charisma check does not change the character’s attitude; a low roll (below 10] simply means the adventurer does not convince the character to do something other than its default reaction.

### Friendly

Friendly characters want to help and wish for the adventurers to succeed. These characters are allies, and they trust the characters. A friendly character owes them loyalty, gratitude, or service as a result of their history together. Few characters begin an encounter friendly.

The only reason to make a check when dealing with a friendly character is to see if the character will take personal risks or make sacrifices on behalf of the adventurers. Otherwise, for tasks or actions that require no particular risk, effort, or cost, friendly characters usually help without question.

FRIENDLY NPC REACTIONS

DC      | Result
--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Default | The NPC will do as you wish for requests that don't involve risks or sacrifice
15      | The NPC accepts a minor risk or sacrifice to do as you wish
25      | The NPC accepts a significant risk or sacrifice to do as you wish
 
### Indifferent

Indifferent characters have no special ties to the adventurers. They might help or hinder the adventurers, depending on what benefits them the most. The vast majority of NPCs in normal situations begin an encounter indifferent.

Note that a character’s indifference does not mean the person is standoffish or uninterested. Indifferent characters might be polite, genial, surly, irritable, or anywhere in between. Being indifferent simply means the NPC does not actively work against the adventurers, nor have they yet earned the NPC’s support as an ally.

A check is usually necessary when the adventurers try to persuade an indifferent character to do something.

INDIFFERENT NPC REACTIONS

DC      | Result
--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------
Default | The NPC offers no help or harm
15      | The NPC will do as you wish without taking risks or making sacrifices
25      | The NPC accepts a minor risk or sacrifice to do as you wish

### Hostile

Hostile characters oppose the adventurers and their goals. They are enemies, and they actively work to see the adventurers fail. They often take actions to harm or stymie the adventurers.

However, a character’s hostility doesn’t mean that the character will attack on sight. For example, a condescending noble might wish to see a group of upstart adventurers fail in order to keep them from rivaling him for the king’s attention; in this case, the noble might be hostile toward the adventurers, but would choose slander and scheming over direct, physical violence as a means of thwarting their efforts.

Adventurers almost always need to make a fairly challenging Charisma check to convince a hostile creature to do anything on their behalf.

HOSTILE NPC REACTIONS

DC      | Result
--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Default | The NPC opposes your actions and may take risks to do so
15      | The NPC offers no help or harm
25      | The NPC will help you as long as there are no risks or sacrifices involved

## Changing Attitudes	

Character attitudes are not set in stone, and the attitude of a character interacting with the party might change over the course of a conversation. Attitudes are fluid, and sometimes shift (either temporarily, or permanently] based on ongoing interactions.

Permanently changing a character’s attitude requires a significant effort. It’s impossible to completely change an attitude over the course of a brief conversation, but it can change over time. A character’s attitude changes in response to actions, not words. If a character offers help to the adventurers, who then abuse that offer, the character might become hostile. Likewise, a hostile character who profits from the party’s actions can become indifferent or even friendly. After any interaction, the Dungeon Master can change the character’s attitude for the purposes of his or her next interaction with the party if the long-term results of the interaction harmed or benefited the character.

Temporarily changing a character’s attitude, however, is somewhat easier and can have a significant effect on the outcome of an interaction. If the adventurers say or do the right things during an interaction, they can make a hostile character temporarily indifferent, or an indifferent character temporarily friendly. Likewise, a gaffe, insult or harmful deed might make a friendly character temporarily indifferent, or an indifferent character hostile.

Typically, you cannot shift a character’s attitude (either temporarily, or permanently] more than one step during a single interaction.

## Ideals, Flaws, and Bonds

All characters have character traits known as ideals, flaws, and bonds, which can be used during an interaction to temporarily change a character’s attitude. Touching positively on a character’s ideals, flaws, or bonds during an interaction can shift the character’s attitude in a positive direction, and vice versa.

Ideals motivate the character to act in a certain way. This encompasses everything from the character’s life goal to a core belief system.

Ideals might answer any of these questions: What are the principles that this character will never betray? What would prompt this character to make sacrifices? What drives this character to act and guides its goals and ambitions? What is the single most important thing this character strives for?

Flaws represent the vices, compulsions, fears, and weaknesses of a character.

Flaws might answer any of these questions: What enrages the character? What is the one thing that he or she cannot bear to witness without becoming angry? What is the character afraid of? What’s the one person, concept, or event that he or she is terrified of? What are the character’s vices?

Bonds represent the character’s connection to people, places, and events in the world.

Bonds might answer any of these questions: Whom does the character care most about? To where does the character feel a special connection? What is the character’s most treasured possession?

Whenever a request or statement in an interaction touches on a character’s ideals, flaws, or bonds, it might have a positive or negative impact on the character’s reaction, making it easier or harder to persuade the character to act. Here are some examples:

*	A druid’s ideals include protecting the forest. Asking the druid to help burn down the forest betrays this ideal and would shift the druid’s reaction toward hostility.
*	The head of the Thieves’ Guild holds ideals involving profit and larceny. Asking the guildmaster for help in pulling off a heist plays into this ideal and might get a more positive response.
*	A barbarian chieftain’s flaw might be a fear of being perceived as weak. Trying to persuade him to back down from a fight would play right into that fear, shifting his attitude toward hostility.
*	A farmer’s flaw might be an overwhelming fear of orcs raiding his farm. Persuading him to flee his home is much easier if the characters can play off that fear.
*	A noble’s bonds might include his love for his dearest daughter. Asking him to put her at risk for any reason threatens that bond and shifts his attitude toward hostility.
*	A paladin’s bonds might include his fondness for his home village. Asking him to help defend the village from attack is a relatively easy task.

## Learning a Character's Traits

If the adventurers can learn another character’s ideals, flaws, or bonds before or during an interaction, they can gain a significant advantage compared to stumbling blindly through the interaction. Knowing a character’s traits allows them to avoid the pitfalls associated with negatively provoking the character and might allow them to present their requests in the most favorable way.

After interacting with another character for at least 10 minutes, feeling out the subject's personality and traits through conversation, a character can attempt a Wisdom (Insight] check to uncover one of the character’s ideals, flaws, or bonds. The player declares what type of trait (ideal, flaw, or bond] he or she wants to uncover, and the DC is based on the subject’s Wisdom score.

Characters with a higher Wisdom are more in control of themselves and better able to mask their inner concerns.

Increase the DC by up to 10 if the character consciously tries to hide a trait. If the adventurer’s check fails by 10 or more, the player character might misidentify a trait. The DM might provide a false trait or invert one of the character’s existing traits. For example, if an old sage’s flaw is that he is prejudiced against the uneducated, the inverse would indicate that the sage enjoys personally seeing to the education of the downtrodden.

## Resolving the Interaction

After making sure that every character has had the opportunity to engage in the interaction to the extent he or she desires, and that the players have had time to discover all that they want to know about a character’s ideals, flaws, and bonds, the DM can call for a Charisma check. (Depending on the approach the characters take, the Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion skills might apply.] This Charisma check signals the climactic moment of the interaction, which sets the subject’s course of action with its outcome.
Other characters participating in an interaction can influence it, for better or worse.

If a helping character says or does something that would influence the interaction in a positive way, the character making the Charisma check can do so with advantage. On the other hand, if a “helping” character says something stupid or offensive, the character making the Charisma check has disadvantage on that check.

Once the check has been made, further attempts are usually fruitless, at least for the time being. If the players try to press the issue once the check has been made and resolved, they run the risk of upsetting or angering the subject, potentially shifting his or her attitude toward hostility.
