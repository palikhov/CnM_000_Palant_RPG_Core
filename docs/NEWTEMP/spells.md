3rd-level transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action Range: Self Duration: 10 minutes
Wrapping yourself in power from the Elemental Planes, you assume an elemental mantle for the duration. The effects of the mantle are determined by the element you choose.
Air: You are unaffected by difficult terrain on the ground. The range of all your weapon attacks is doubled, and ranged weapon attacks have disadvantage against you or targets within 5 feet of you.
Earth: You are unaffected by difficult terrain that results from rock or rubble, and the ground within 20 feet of you is difficult terrain to others. Additionally, when you take bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, you can use your reaction to halve that damage.
Fire: You are immune to fire damage. When a creature within 5 feet of you hits or misses you with a melee attack, or otherwise makes physical contact with you, that creature takes 1d6 fire damage. In addition, your melee attacks deal 1d6 extra fire damage.
Water: You have a swim speed equal to your land speed, and you can breathe underwater.

1-2 Until the end of the creature's next turn, the
creature's speed is halved, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.
3-4 The only action the creature can take on its next turn is an attack against a randomly determined target within range.
5-6 Until the end of the creature's next turn, the
