# Modified Three Pillar

This version of three pillar experience rewards players for exploration and social interaction, while maintaining the traditional character advancement scale and allowing the GM to reward XP for encounters.

Instead of rewarding a fixed amount, for Exploration and Social Interaction players receive a percentage of the XP required for them to get from their current level to the next \(calculated from the base XP of their level to the next, not including XP they've earned in between.\)

They may receive a higher or lower percentage depending on the their tier of play compared to the magnitude of their accomplishment.   

## Gaining Levels

Players gain levels according to the normal PHB Character Advancement table.

| XP | Level | XP to Next Level |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0 | 1 | 300 |
| 300 | 2 | 600 |
| 900 | 3 | 1,800 |
| 2,700 | 4 | 3,800 |
| 6,500 | 5 | 7,500 |
| 14,000 | 6 | 9,000 |
| 23,000 | 7 | 11,000 |
| 34,000 | 8 | 14,000 |
| 48,000 | 9 | 16,000 |
| 64,000 | 10 | 21,000 |
| 85,000 | 11 | 15,000 |
| 100,000 | 12 | 20,000 |
| 120,000 | 13 | 20,000 |
| 140,000 | 14 | 25,000 |
| 165,000 | 15 | 30,000 |
| 195,000 | 16 | 30,000 |
| 225,000 | 17 | 40,000 |
| 265,000 | 18 | 40,000 |
| 302,000 | 19 | 50,000 |
| 355,000 | 20 | See Epic Boons |

## Dividing XP

For Exploration and Social Interaction, the XP award for an adventure is the same for each member of the party, instead of being divided among them.

     However, this does not mean the XP is awarded for individual merit. XP is awarded when the party as a whole accomplishes something, without splitting hairs about who contributed to what the most.   

### Pillar 1: Exploration

For discovering both Items and Locations, each player gains 5% at their tier, 5% additional for every tier above, none for below their tier.   

#### Items

In this version, players are rewarded for discovering magic items that are of the highest nonconsumable rarity suggested for their tier as per Xanathar's Guide.

| Tier 1 | A single art object or gem worth 100 gp or more, or a major uncommon item |
| :--- | :--- |
| Tier 2 | A single art object or gem worth 1,000 gp or more, or a major rare item |
| Tier 3 | A single art object or gem worth 5,000 gp or more, or a major very rare item |
| Tier 4 | A single art object or gem worth 50,000 gp or more, or a major legendary item |

#### Locations

A location's tier depends on the importance to your campaign, measured by the scope of its discovery or liberation's impact:

| Tier 1 | A location important to a small town or village |
| :--- | :--- |
| Tier 2 | A location vital to a kingdom |
| Tier 3 | A location important across the world |
| Tier 4 | A location of cosmic importance |

### Pillar 2: Social Interaction

#### NPCs

Players gain XP for turning important NPCs into allies, aligning them with their cause or denying them as assets to their enemies. The XP they gain is based on the NPC's power and influence.

      Each player gains 5% at their tier, 5% additional for every tier above, 2% for below their tier.

| Tier 1 | An NPC with influence over a small town or village, or the equivalent |
| :--- | :--- |
| Tier 2 | An NPC with influence over a city or the equivalent |
| Tier 3 | An NPC with influence over a kingdom, continent, or the equivalent |
| Tier 4 | An NPC \(including a deity\) with cosmic significance or influence across multiple worlds. |

#### Role Play

This modified Three Pillar method also rewards players for inter-party role play. The difficulty of inter-party role play should remain fairly constant throughout all tiers of play, so unlike the other categories in this method it is not awarded based on tier. Instead, it is awarded for specific group activities.

When the party interacts in character during a session, each member gains 5%. If the interaction is only partially in character, they gain 2%. If they create a story-changing or divergent moment, they gain an extra 5%.

Here are some examples of these interactions \(obviously party interaction situations are not limited to these\):

The party argues in character.

The party comes to a decision in character.

The party solves a mystery or puzzle in character.

Some party members conspire to play a trick on another party member

Some party members confront other party members about a problem or secret.

The party convinces an NPC to give them information that the NPC previously did not want to give, a significantly lower price on an item, or another form of important help.

More than half the party gains inspiration or role plays their TBIFs.

The party agrees to take a quest from an NPC in need.   

### Pillar 3: Combat

Players gain 85% of the encounter XP, rounding decimals down, divided between them and any NPCs that contributed. This is used for combats, traps, and puzzles which award XP.

#### **Reddit Formatting**

I liked the idea of three pillar experience, but it had many flaws, so I made some heavy modifications. Here's why it's better:

* It uses the regular Character Advancement table from the Player's Handbook
* It allows to DM to award encounter XP
* It rewards players for inter-party role play as well as role play with NPC's
* It rewards players for discovering the rarest items appropriate to their tier according to Xanathar's Guide \(the original required players to discover items above their tier.\)

## The Three Pillars of Play

For an explaination of the three pillars of play, see the original UA. In short, players get XP for each of the three pillars: exploration, social interaction, and combat.

## Social Interaction

### NPCs

Players gain XP for turning important NPCs into allies, aligning them with their cause or denying them as assets to their enemies. The XP they gain is based on the NPC's power and influence.

Each player gains 5% for a goal at their tier, 5% additional for every tier above, 2% for a goal below their tier.

\|  Tier \| Goal                                                                                     \|

\| ----- \| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \|

\| 1     \| An NPC with influence over a small town or village, or the equivalent                    \|

\| 2     \| An NPC with influence over a city or the equivalent                                      \|

\| 3     \| An NPC with influence over a kingdom, continent, or the equivalent                       \|

\| 4     \| An NPC \(including a deity\) with cosmic significance or influence across multiple worlds. \|

### Role Play

The difficulty of inter-party role play should remain fairly constant throughout all tiers of play, so unlike the other categories in this method it is not awarded based on tier. Instead, it is awarded for specific group activities.

Here are some examples of these interactions \(obviously party interaction situations are not limited to these\):

* More than half the party gains inspiration or role plays their traits, ideals, bonds, or flaws.
* The party agrees to take a quest from an NPC in need.  

## Combat

Players gain 85% of the encounter XP, rounding decimals down, divided between them and any NPCs that contributed. This is used for combats, traps, and puzzles which award XP.

Full encounter XP is not given to balance for the fact that the recommended XP awards for monsters do not take into account that players will be awarded XP for anything else.  Additionally, this means that players must engage with the other tiers to advance at a normal rate.
