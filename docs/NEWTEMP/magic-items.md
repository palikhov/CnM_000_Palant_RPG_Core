# MAGIC ITEMS

## Wearing Magic Items

In most cases, a magic item that’s meant to be worn will adjust its size to suit a creature regardless of the wearer’s gender or race. If you have a good reason for why a magic item shouldn’t fit, though, run with it. Armor made specifically by the self-absorbed drow might fit elves only. Dwarves might make items usable only by dwarf¬sized and dwarf-shaped characters to keep such items from being used against them. Such items should be exceptions, however, not the rule.

Use common sense to determine whether more than one of a given kind of magic item can be worn. Can a character wear two necklaces? Of course ! People in the real world wear multiple necklaces, amulets, medallions, and holy symbols at the same time, and there’s no prohibition against a character employing a necklace of fireballs while wearing an amulet of protection. Two belts? Sure, that’s easy to picture, perhaps with a weapon hanging from each one. But can a character wear two pairs of boots? No, that’s silly.

The simple rule is that a character can’t wear more than one pair of footwear (boots, sandals, slippers, and so on], more than one pair of gloves or gauntlets, more than one suit of armor, more than one cloak, or more than one item of headwear (a helmet, hat, circlet, crown, or similar item]. Feel free to impose other limits or grant exceptions where appropriate. For instance, a hat of disguise might allow the wearing of a mask or a circlet, but a character is unlikely to be able to wear two sets of bracers.

Items that are meant to function in pairs, including boots, bracers, gauntlets, and gloves, do not impart their benefits unless the entire pair is worn. A character can’t wear a boot of striding and springing on one foot and a boot of elvenkind on the other foot to use the properties of either or both magic items.

## Magic Item Attunement

Some magic items require a character to attune to them before the magical properties of those items can be enjoyed.

Attuning to a Magic Item: Attuning to a magic item requires that you first discover whether you can attune yourself to it. The identify spell is the most common way of discovering this fact. Unusual items magically reveal that fact to certain types of creatures or in certain circumstances.

The attunement process requires you to grasp or wear the item and spend 10 minutes concentrating on it. Depending on the nature of the item, this concentration can take the form of prayers, weapon practice, or meditation. In any case, the concentration period must be uninterrupted.

When you are attuned to an item, you can use any magical properties that require attunement. You also learn how to activate those abilities and any necessary command words or phrases to do so. See “Using a Magic Item” for different methods of magic item activation.
An item can be attuned to only one creature at a time. A magic item might require you to meet one or more prerequisites before you can become attuned to it.

## Using a Magic Item

Each magic item has one or more magical properties that it imparts to its user when properly held, wielded, or donned. How a user activates the item’s properties varies from item to item.

**Worn:** Many items must be worn to gain their benefits. A suit of armor must be donned, a shield strapped to the arm, a cloak fastened about the shoulders, a ring placed on a finger, and so on. Simply carrying around an item that’s meant to be worn is not sufficient to gain its benefits.

**Wielded:** Most magic weapon properties apply when the weapon is used in combat. A weapon might have properties that are useful when the item is drawn or held.

**Action Activated:** A magic item that falls into this category requires an action to activate. Potions, scrolls, and many wondrous items fall into this category.

Some item properties not only take an action to activate, but also require the item’s user to speak a command word or phrase. The command word or phrase must be spoken in an area where hearing is possible.

**Consumable:** Some magic items are used up when activated. Many consumable items are also action-activated items. Once activated, a consumable item loses its magic and no longer functions.

**Special Activations:** Sometimes a user must do something special to activate a magic item, as indicated in the magic item’s descriptive text.

### Elven Chain

**Very rare magic armor (mithral shirt)**

Elven chain is exceptionally fine and light mithral chain mail, elaborately decorated with woven lines that twist like vines, and incorporating other precious metals, such as silver, gold, and platinum.

Donning the armor feels like slipping into a silk tunic, and the chain mail does not constrain the wearer’s movement. The magic woven into the elven chain enables the wearer to cast spells freely as well.

Mithral armor is usually made by dwarves, who mine the metal deep in the earth. Where dwarves and elves come together for trade or another common purpose, elven smiths craft fine shirts of the metal.

The elves guard elven chain jealously. In ancient times, they sometimes bestowed such armor on a dwarf who had earned their friendship, but generally it is meant for elves' use. A gift of such armor is a sign of deep respect.

**Property:** You can wear this armor as if you were proficient with it.

### Dagger of Venom

**Rare magic weapon (dagger)**

The black, obsidian blade of this weapon is serrated on one edge. Its pommel is carved to resemble two fanged serpents that twine together, their outstretched heads forming the blade’s quillon. Anyone wielding the blade notes a bitter, acrid scent from it.

A dagger of venom is most often crafted for the use of a yuan-ti or a powerful assassin. Each of these weapons has a distinct pattern to its blade or pommel that indicates its original owner. Assassins’ guilds and yuan-ti cults prize these blades as relics. If news of such a dagger reaches them, they send agents to collect the weapon by trickery or force.

**Property:** You gain a +1 bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls you make with this dagger. The saving throw DC of any poison you apply to the dagger increases by 2.

Once per day, you can use an action to cause thick, black poison to cover the dagger’s blade.

The poison remains for 1 minute or until you hit with an attack using this weapon. When you hit a living creature with this weapon while it’s coated in this poison, the creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it becomes paralyzed for 1 minute.

### Frost Brand

**Very rare magic weapon (long sword)**

The blade of this long sword is constantly rimed with frost and ice, and its hilt is wrapped in white leather. When it is drawn from its scabbard, nearby fires gutter, and a plume of condensing air steams from the weapon’s surface.

**Property:** You gain a +1 bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls you make with this weapon. On a hit with this weapon, you deal 1d6 extra cold damage.

While you have this sword drawn and in hand, you have fire resistance.

While drawn and in hand in freezing temperatures, the sword also sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for 10 feet beyond that.

Finally, once per hour, when you draw this weapon, you can choose to douse all nonmagical flames within 30 feet of you.

Wand of Binding

Rare magic wand

This wand is actually a length of chain held rigid by the magic that infuses it. The chain is crafted from adamantine, and runes of binding and imprisonment adorn each link.

Property [Attuned]: You must be a cleric, a druid, or a mage to become attuned to this item.

The wand has 7 charges. As an action, you can expend the specified number of charges to cast one of the following spells from the wand.

*	***hold person*** (2 charges]

*	***hold monster*** (6 charges]

If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand blackens and crumbles to dust, forever destroyed. The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges each day at dawn. In addition, while you hold the wand, you can expend a charge as a reaction whenever you make a saving throw to resist the hold person or the hold monster spell to gain advantage on your saving throw.

### Potion of Heroism

***Rare potion**

This colorless potion steams as if boiling.

Sampling or drinking it causes the imbiber to feel immensely healthy and robust.

**Property [Consumable]:** As an action, you drink the potion. You gain 10 temporary hit points. These hit points can cause you to exceed your hit point maximum, and they cannot be regained. If you take any damage, these hit points are lost first. In addition, you gain a +2 bonus to ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws. Finally, the saving throw DC of any spell you cast or magic item you use, or that results from something else you do by increases by 2.

The effects wear off after 1 hour.

### Ring of Wizardry
**Very rare ring**

Silver sigils of stars, comets, and suns are engraved on this bone ring.

Crafting a ring of wizardry involves several astounding feats of magic now lost to academic spellcasters. A mage must grow a clone, invest the clone with the knowledge of magic, and harvest a finger from it. From this finger’s bones a ring of wizardry is carved. A story exists about the “Nine-Fingered Mage,” a clone who escaped the complete ring-making process, but not soon enough to save every digit.

**Property (attuned):** If you are a wizard, add one to the number of spell slots you have for each level of spell you can cast up to 4th level.

### Cloak of Elvenkind
**Uncommon wondrous item**

This long cloak is fashioned from gray cloth, expertly crafted, and is half the weight of a normal cloak.

**An elf who sees a non-elf wearing a cloak of this sort might assume the cloak is stolen.** In some cases, however, cloaks of elvenkind are presented as gifts to the elves’ most trusted and valued allies.

**Property:** While you wear a cloak of elvenkind with the hood up, you can attempt to hide in any natural environment, as long as no creatures are within 20 feet of you. You do not have to be obscured to make the attempt, but you must stay quiet.
