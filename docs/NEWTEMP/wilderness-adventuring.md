# Wilderness Adventuring

Sometimes in a D&D adventure, travel through the wilderness is purely a matter of description. Players describe where their characters are headed, and you narrate what happens on the way. At other times, the journey is as important to the adventure as its destination, and wilderness exploration rules will come into play.

This section provides a turn-based system for traveling outdoors. The rules address how to move through and investigate a wilderness area, and they discuss environmental considerations such as weather and high altitude.

An optional section has rules that cover tasks characters can undertake while exploring in the outdoors, and how those tasks are performed, plus a system for determining what happens if the characters get lost in the wilderness.

Your Outdoor Map

Before the characters can explore a wilderness or other outdoor area, you need to have a map that outlines its key geographic features and terrain.

The outdoor environment you’re mapping might be an expanse of wilderness on the surface of the world or a vast subterranean location, such as the great caverns and passages of the Underdark. Either way, it’s better to use a hex grid than a square grid for mapping, because a hex grid enables more precise calculation of the distance between two points.

The scale of your outdoor map depends on how much detail you want. For the most detailed areas, each hex or square represents 1 mile. To cover larger areas, each hex or square represents 6 miles. Your largest scale maps, those covering massive areas, should cover 36 miles per hex or square.

Just as you would do in a dungeon, track the characters’ movement on your outdoor map to determine what sort of terrain they encounter, monster lairs, settlements, or other noteworthy features they might stumble across. To keep things simple, assume that the characters find a noteworthy location when they enter its hex or square, unless the site is specifically hidden. The characters might not walk directly up to the front door of a ruined castle in the 1-mile-wide hex they just entered, but they can find old paths, outlying ruins, and such signs of its presence in the area with ease.

**Visibility.** When traveling outdoors, characters can see about 2 miles in any direction on a clear day, assuming that trees, hills, and other obstructions don’t block their view. Rain cuts visibility down to 1 mile, and fog cuts it down to a few hundred feet.
Multiply the distance the characters can see by 20 if they are atop a mountain or a tall hill, or are otherwise able to look down upon the area around them from a lofty height.

## Terrain

Outdoor terrain is represented by a few general categories that describe how difficult it is to travel through an area of that terrain and (in the optional rules] find food and water.

For the purpose of travel, terrain is either normal, difficult or very difficult, with difficult terrain cutting the characters’ speed by one third, and very difficult terraint - by two third while they travel through it

If the characters travel by a road or path, they move at their normal speed regardless of the terrain around them.

TERRAIN SUMMARY | Type Travel
Desert | Normal
Forest	| Difficult
Hills	| Normal
Jungle	| Very Difficult
Mountains	| Very Difficult
Plains	| Normal
Road/Path	| Normal
Swamp	| Very Difficult
Tundra	| Normal

## The Wilderness Turn

This is the sequence of play for an hour of travel and exploration in a wilderness environment.

**1.	Direction and Pace.** The players decide what direction their characters will move in and their travel pace. The players should also determine their formation: who is in the front, the middle, and the back of the group. (If you’re using the optional rules, they also decide on their exploration tasks at this time.]

**2.	Progress on the Map.** Determine the distance and the direction the characters traveled, taking into account their travel pace and chosen path.

**3.	Random Encounters.** Check for a random encounter and, if one is indicated, resolve any interaction or combat that occurs between the creatures and the characters.

**4.	Environmental Effects.** Apply effects of the environment, weather, or terrain, such as extreme cold. Some of these effects might require saving throws from the characters. In addition, if the characters attempt a forced march, resolve saving throws for that activity at this point.

If exploration continues, go back to the first step and repeat the sequence for another turn.

## Travel Pace

The travel pace that the characters choose—fast, moderate, or slow—determines the chance that monsters and other threats surprise them, how much distance they can cover during an hour of movement, and (in the optional rules] what tasks they can perform as they travel.

Explain to the players what their choices are. Do they want to get through the next area quickly, without much care for possible dangers, or are they determined to move slowly and keep a close watch for anything along their path? When the group decides on a travel pace, use the line on the Travel Pace table that corresponds to their intent. If the party splits up, each smaller group chooses its own pace.

The travel pace of an exploring group determines its readiness. This quality is expressed as a DC that you can use for several circumstances, such as when a character makes a Wisdom saving throw at the start of a battle to avoid being surprised or (in the optional rules] when the characters are in danger of becoming lost.

Travel pace also determines the greatest distance a group can cover during an hour, as shown on the table. Difficult terrain, including forests, mountains, jungles, and swamps reduces travel speed by half. For example, a group moving at a moderate pace through a forest can expect to traverse no more than 1 mile every hour.

Travel Pace | Distance traveled by minute | Speed per hour | Distance per day | | Pace Readiness DC | Special
--------|--------|--------|--------|--------
Very  Fast | tbd | tbd | tbd | tbd | tbd
Fast | 400 f | 4 m | 30 m | 20 | -5 penalty to passive Wisdom (Perception) scores
Normal | 300 f | 3 m | 24 m | 15 | Passive Perception 
Slow | 200 f | 2 m | 18 m | 10 | able to use stealth, Passice Perception or roll Perception - choose max
Very slow | tbd | 1 m | 12 m | 10| tbd

**Mounts and Vehicles.** For short spans of time (up to an hour), many animals move much faster than humanoids. A mounted character can ride at a gallop for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, characters can cover larger distances at this pace, but this is very rare except in densely populated areas.

Characters in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose a pace as normal. Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessels, and they don't suffer penalties for a fast pace or gain benefits from a slow pace. Depending on the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be able to travel for up to 24 hours per day.

Certain special mounts, such as a pegasus or griffon, or special vehicles, such as a carpet of flying, allow you to travel more swiftly. The Dungeon Master's Guide contains more information on special methods of travel.

**Activity While Traveling**

As adventurers travel through a dungeon or the wilderness, they need to remain alert for danger, and some characters might perform other tasks to help the group's journey.

### Marching Order

The adventurers should establish a marching order.

A marching order makes it easier to determine which characters are affected by traps, which ones can spot hidden enemies, and which ones are the closest to those enemies when a fight breaks out.

A character might occupy the front rank, one or more middle ranks, or the back rank. Characters in the front and back ranks need enough room to travel side by side with others in their rank. When space is too tight, the marching order must change, usually by moving characters to a middle rank.

**Fewer Than Three Ranks.** If an adventuring party arranges its marching order with only two ranks, they are a front rank and a back rank. If there's only one rank, it's considered a front rank.

**For party roster**

Front rank

Middle rank

Rear rank

## Random Encounters

You check at the end of each hour to see whether someone or something inadvertently crosses the adventurers’ path, or vice versa.
The population density of the region determines the likelihood of coming across monsters (see the table]. To check for wandering monsters, roll a d20. If an encounter occurs, roll on the appropriate wandering monster table to determine what the heroes meet. (This table might be one of your devising, or it might be provided inside the adventure you’re running.]

Note that the nature of random encounters depends on the region the characters are exploring. On a civilized road, they are more likely to encounter a wandering tinker or a caravan than a band of monsters.
 
Region | Encounter Chance (d20)
----------|--------------
Sparsely inhabited | 20
Densely inhabited | 18-20
Typical region  | 18-20

## Encountering Creatures

If an exploring group encounters creatures (which might be wandering monsters or might be specific participants in the adventure], the characters can try to attack them, avoid them, or interact with them in some other way.

Alertness	| Readiness DC
--------|----------
Low	| 20
Normal	| 10
High	| 5

## Encounter Distance

Typically, the terrain or layout of an area determines how far the characters are from creatures when the groups become aware of each other. If this distance isn’t predetermined, roll a d20 + 20. Multiply that result by 10 if the area is in normal terrain (such as a grassy field, barren tundra, or a frozen lake] or by 5 if the terrain is difficult (such as rolling hills, or a forest]. The resulting number is the distance in feet between the two groups at the start of their encounter.


Terrain	| Encounter Distance
--------------|---------------------
Arctic, desert, farmland, or grassland | 6d6 × 10 feet
Forest, swamp, or woodland	| 2d8 × 10 feet
Hills or wastelands	| 2d10 × 10 feet
Jungle	| 2d6 × 10 feet
Mountains	| 4d10 × 10 feet
**Audible Distance**
Trying to be quiet | 2d6 × 5 feet
Normal noise level | 2d6 × 10 feet
Very loud	| 2d6 × 50 feet
**Visibility Outdoors**
Clear day, no obstructions | 2 miles
Rain | 1 mile
Fog	| 100 to 300 feet
From a height	| × 20


### Stealth

Before asking the players what they want to do, determine if either group notices the other. One group or the other can avoid detection completely only if all its members are sneaking. Otherwise, contests occur as necessary to determine if anyone sneaking on either side is detected.

### Surprise

If one group is hidden from the other, that group has surprise, as described in the combat rules. Otherwise, each creature and character makes a Wisdom saving throw against a DC that corresponds to its readiness. The readiness DC for characters is determined by their travel pace. For monsters, it depends on their degree of alertness, as shown below.

## Finding Locations and Objects

When the characters come across a location or an object of special note during the performance of their tasks, describe the discovery to them and allow them to take actions as appropriate.

## Weather

In addition to the risk of encountering creatures or stumbling across a strange location, the characters also face mundane weather threats such as heavy rain, freezing cold, or searing heat.

You can pick weather to fit your campaign or roll on the following tables to determine the weather for a given day. Use the table that corresponds to the current season of the year (assuming the region has a temperate climate]. The tables include one for each of the four seasons found in temperate regions, plus two more for exceptionally hot and cold environments such as desert and tundra. You can also use these tables to account for the geography or altitude of a region or area. For instance, the upper heights of a mountain range will be cold and snowy even in a warm climate.

**Temperate Spring/Fall**

No special weather | Storm (light rain) | Storm (heavy rain)

Temperate | Winter	Weather (d20)

Cold	| 1-14

Cold, storm (snow)	| 18-20

Cold, storm (heavy snow) | 16-20

**Temperate Summer**

No special weather Hot

Storm (heavy rain)

**Desert**

Hot

Hot, storm (dust)

Storm (heavy rain)

**Tundra**

Cold

Cold, storm (snow)

Cold, storm (heavy snow)

### Cold Weather

While the temperature is below 0 degrees Fahrenheit, characters exposed to the cold must make DC 10 Constitution saves at the end of each hour. Characters without cold weather gear, such as thick coats, gloves, and so on, automatically fail this save.

On a failed saving throw, a character gains a level of exhaustion.

### Storm

Bad weather, such as snow, rain, powerful winds, dust storms, and other hazards, reduces travel speeds by half, quartering speed in total when combined with difficult terrain.

In addition, specific types of storms have the following additional effects.

**Dust Storm**. Visibility is reduced to 50 feet, and creatures suffer disadvantage on saves to avoid becoming surprised.

**Heavy Rain**. Visibility is reduced to 50 feet, and creatures suffer disadvantage on saves to avoid becoming surprised.

**Heavy Snow**. Visibility is reduced to 50 feet, and creatures suffer disadvantage on saves to avoid becoming surprised. Heavy snow continues to reduce speed as described above for 1d6 days after the storm.

### Hot Weather

In exceptionally hot weather (at or above 100 degrees Fahrenheit], characters exposed to the heat must make DC 10 Constitution saves at the end of each hour. Characters wearing medium or heavy armor or otherwise clad in heavy clothing suffer disadvantage on this save.
On a failed saving throw, a character gains a level of exhaustion.

### High Altitude

Traveling at altitudes above 10,000 feet is particularly taxing due to the lack of oxygen in the air. Each hour spent traveling counts as two hours for purposes of determining how long characters can travel.

Exhausted characters cannot rest to reduce their exhaustion while above 10,000 feet.

Characters and creature can become acclimated to high altitude. Doing so requires spending many months at this elevation. Creatures cannot become acclimated to elevations above 20,000 feet. 

Creatures that do not need to breathe, such as undead creatures or constructs, suffer no ill effects from high altitude.

## Food and Water

In the wilderness, carrying enough food and water to survive is critical to survival. Characters who run short of either suffer the effects of exhaustion.

### Water

A character consumes one gallon of water per day, or two gallons each day if the weather is hot. A character who has only half that much water available must make a DC 10 Constitution save or suffer a level of exhaustion at the end of the day. A character with access to even less water suffers one automatic level of exhaustion that day.

If the character already has one or more levels of exhaustion, the character takes two levels in either case.

### Food

A one day supply of food is about equivalent to one pound of supplies. A character can go 3 + Constitution modifier days without food. If a character eats half a pound of food, that counts as going half a day without food. A normal day of eating resets the count of days without food to zero.

After that time period, a character automatically suffers a level of exhaustion for each day without food, or must make a DC Constitution save or take a level of exhaustion for each day of eating half a pound of food.

## Food and Creature Size

The rules for food and water assume that the characters are size Medium. Creatures of different sizes, including non-humanoids such as horses, need different amounts of sustenance.

Small creatures consume half as much food and water.

Large creatures consumer four times as much.

Huge creatures require sixteen times as much.

Gargantuan needs 32 times the supplies.

Colossal require 64 times as much food and water.

## Optional Wilderness Exploration Rules

The basic exploration rules cover all the basic movements of managing a journey from one place to the next. The following, optional rules add more detail and realism to the process by introducing specific tasks that the characters can take while traveling. They are especially useful for when the characters travel into the deep wilderness, far from any civilized lands.

### Exploration Tasks

An exploration task is a duty a character assumes for the duration of an exploration turn, a duty that usually contributes to the group's overall disposition and preparedness. Characters choose their tasks during the first step of an exploration turn.

After the group has agreed on its pace, explain to the players what their choices are for exploration tasks and ask what task each character will undertake. When a party is traveling at a fast pace, there's no time for characters to perform any of these tasks.
When each character has chosen a task, have the players roll ability checks to determine the outcome of their characters' tasks, then resolve any situations that arise from the success or failure of those checks.

A character can perform up to two tasks during an exploration turn, but dividing one's attention and energy is risky. If a character takes two actions, any ability checks associated with those actions have disadvantage.

Activities that require an action during a combat round, such as casting a spell, don’t count as exploration tasks. There’s no hard limit on the number of such activities a character can perform.

#### Foraging

**PHB:** The character can keep an eye out for ready sources of food and water, making a Wisdom (Survival) check when the DM calls for it. (The Dungeon Master's Guide has rules for foraging.)

The characters can gather food and water as they travel, especially if they are running low on supplies. When a character chooses this task, the character makes a single Wisdom (Survival] check with a DC determined by the abundance of food and water in the region. If the check succeeds, that character finds a quantity of pounds of food and gallons of water equal to the 1d6 + the character's Wisdom modifier.

If multiple characters choose this task, they each make separate ability checks. More characters foraging can find food to feed more people.

FORAGING DCS

Terrain	| DC
--------|-------
Abundant	| 10
Average	| 15
Desolate	| 20

**Characters who turn their attention to other tasks as the group travels are not focused on watching for danger. These characters don't contribute their passive Wisdom (Perception) scores to the group's chance of noticing hidden threats.**


Foraging DCs

Food and Water Availability	DC
Abundant food and water sources	10
Limited food and water sources	15
Very little, if any, food and water sources	20

If multiple characters forage, each character makes a separate check. A foraging character finds nothing on a failed check. On a successful check, roll 1d6 + the character's Wisdom modifier to determine how much food (in pounds) the character finds, then repeat the roll for water (in gallons).

Food and Water
p111
The food and water requirements noted in the Player's Handbook are for characters. Horses and other creatures require different quantities of food and water per day based on their size. Water needs are doubled if the weather is hot.

Food and Water Needs
Creature Size	Food per Day	Water per Day
Tiny	1/4 pound	1/4 gallon
Small	1 pound	1 gallon
Medium	1 pound	1 gallon
Large	4 pounds	4 gallons
Huge	16 pounds	16 gallons
Gargantuan	64 pounds	64 gallons

#### Keeping Watch

It helps to keep an eye and an ear open for danger. When a character chooses keeping watch as an exploration task, the character makes a single Wisdom (Perception] check to detect hidden creatures and an Intelligence (Search] check to detect hidden objects as the group travels during the current exploration turn. A character’s check result is used to contest the checks of any creatures that are attempting to hide from the explorers. If someone keeping watch detects a creature, it cannot surprise the group.

#### Mapmaking

**PHB:** Draw a Map. The character can draw a map that records the group's progress and helps the characters get back on course if they get lost. No ability check is required.

Making an accurate map is vital to ensuring that explorers have the best sense of their surroundings. It can also help keep them from becoming lost.

When a character chooses mapmaking as an exploration task, the character must have a writing instrument and some surface (such as paper or parchment] on which to record the map.

The map a character creates might be similar to your actual map of the area, but not as complete. When you give out information to a player whose character is mapping, restrict that information to only what the character would perceive while “actually” performing the task.

If more than one character chooses this task, those who do so simply create multiple maps of the area. (This strategy can prove useful if one character’s map is lost or destroyed later in the adventure.]

**Characters who turn their attention to other tasks as the group travels are not focused on watching for danger. These characters don't contribute their passive Wisdom (Perception) scores to the group's chance of noticing hidden threats.**


#### Track

**PHB:** A character can follow the tracks of another creature, making a Wisdom (Survival) check when the DM calls for it. (The Dungeon Master's Guide has rules for tracking.)  

#### Navigating



Traveling in the wilderness or a large, unfamiliar city carries the risk of becoming lost. A character can reduce this risk by navigating for the group, keeping a careful eye out for landmarks and the position of the sun, the moon, and stars.
When a character chooses navigating as an exploration task, the character makes a single Wisdom (Survival] check to prevent the group from losing its way during the current exploration turn. If more than one member of the group chooses this task, each navigator makes a check, and you use the best result to determine if the group becomes lost.

**Characters who turn their attention to other tasks as the group travels are not focused on watching for danger. These characters don't contribute their passive Wisdom (Perception) scores to the group's chance of noticing hidden threats.**

#### Sneaking

Keeping a low profile is often the best option in a dangerous area. When a character chooses sneaking as an exploration task, the character makes a single Dexterity (Stealth] check to hide as the group travels. Anyone who chooses this task has advantage on this check if the group’s travel pace is slow. To notice a sneaking character, a creature must contest the character’s check, using Wisdom (Perception] or Intelligence (iNVESTIGATION], and win.x`

#### Improvised Tasks

A character might think of some way to contribute to an exploring group that isn't covered by the tasks described here. If so, you can allow the use of an improvised exploration task, but only if its performance requires no more than one-third of the time encompassed by an exploration turn. Also, as with other tasks, a character can't perform an improvised task if the group's travel pace is fast.

### CAMPING

Characters can carry a tent to protect themselves against wind and rain, but sometimes they don't have access to that kind of gear, and in those situations they can try to find a natural shelter or build one using materials they can gather. 

**Natural shelters** are divided in two types: basic and advanced 

**Basic Shelter.** Almost every natural shelter found in the wild is considered as a basic shelter. This shelter has enough space for 4 medium-sized creatures, and in general they're constructed from many small pieces of vegetation. Due to its simple design, a basic shelter protects against wind or precipitation (determined by the DM)

**Advanced Shelter.** An advanced shelter have space for 6 medium-sized creatures or more and protects everyone inside against the wind rain, snow and other environmental features. Additionally, an advanced shelter helps to maintain the personal temperature and in some cases it also provides some defenses against wild creatures.

### Условия для нормального отдыха

Базовые условия: температура от 10 до 30 град, без дождя - спальник

#### NATURAL SHELTERS

Terrain and time are the mayor factors that determines the chance for adventurers to be able to locate a natural shelter or construct something out of materials they find the zone.

Arctic zones has no useful vegetation that adventurers can use for shelter, but they can find crevasses and make improvised snow walls that can provide some protection.

Desert zones has no vegetation that adventurers can use, but they can run across irregularities in the surface, such as large rocks and some dunes that can provide shelter on at least one side.

Forest zones are one of the easiest terrains to find natural shelter. Trees and large plants can give adventurers some protection from wind and rain. In a forest, boughs or branches can be cut from trees and laid across a grid of poles to give characters a roof over their heads and protection from wind mils are full of irregular terrain that can serve as a simple windbreak. Additionally, thick vegetation is fairly abundant during most of the year, allowing adventurers to fashion a windbreak out of it.

Mountains, for this purpose, are considered to be rough, rocky areas with little or no vegetation. However, adventurers can come across some natural features, such as caves and alcoves that are large enough for the group.

Plains are generally flat, but not necessarily featureless. A small gully might help adventurers to get out of the wind Additionally, if a plain has some vegetation, characters may be able to gather enough branches and greenery for a windbreak.

Swamps commonly have vegetation that can be scavenged and used as shelter, and characters can come across a fallen tree or similar feature that can help as a shelter.

#### FINDING NATURAL SHELTER

Characters can make a Wisdom (Survival) check to try to find a natural shelter in the area. Depending on the terrain, the difficulty and time to find an appropriate shelter varies, as shown in the following table.

Terrain	| DC | Time Needed
--------|--------|--------
Arctic | 25 |	30 minutes
Desert | 25 | 30 minutes
Forest | 1O | 10 minutes
Hills | 1O | 10 minutes
Mountains | 20 | 20 minutes
Plains | 20 | 20 minutes
Swamps | 15 | 15 minutes

##$# ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS

You can increase the DC and time depending on some special conditions, such as looking for a shelter in the night or while it's raining.

*	Rain, fog and low visibility areas. Increase the DC by 3 and add half the base time.

*	Storm, snowfall and no visibility areas. Increase the DC by 5 and it takes twice the base time.

### UPGRADING A SHELTER

While characters can look for natural shelter, they can also gather materials and upgrade a basic shelter into an advanced shelter or add extra features, such as a palisade wall or other defensive measures.

### COLLECTING MATERIALS

A character can gather materials by making an Wisdom (Survival) check or a Strength (Athletics) check. Use the table under the Finding Natural Shelter part to determine the DC and time used for collecting materials. During this activity, the character gather branches and vegetation that is lying in the area, cut down a tree to collect wood or mine a big rock to collect stones. 
On a success, it collects a number of units equal to 2d6 + its Constitution modifier. A character can make a number of checks per day equal to twice its Constitution modifier (minimum 1)

### UPGRADING

For upgrading a shelter, the character must use a number of units of materials depending on which feature they want, as shown in the table below. Multiple characters can combine their efforts toward the upgrading of the shelter, reducing the time by ten times its Constitution modifier for each character working on the upgrade to a minimum of 10 minutes. For example, a character with a Constitution modifier of +2 will reduce the time it takes to finish a shelter feature by 20 minutes.

Feature	| Units Required | Time
--------|--------|--------
Advanced shelter upgrade | 15 | 4 hours
Basic wall | 6 | 1 hour
Platform | 10 | 2 hours
Spike barrier | 5 | 30 minutes
Stone wall | 10 | 4 hours

**Advanced Shelter Upgrade.** Upgrading a basic shelter into an advanced shelter includes a door, simple roofing and walls made from various pieces of thatch, wood, stone or similar. Upgrading a shelter allows up to 6 medium-sized creatures to enter and protect themselves.

**Basic Wall** This 15-feet long, 6 feet tall fence or wall is made from wooden stakes, tree trunks, adobe or even bones, and it’s used as a defensive structure or enclosure. Each 5 feet of wall has an AC 15,15 hit points and a damage threshold of
**Platform.** This 10-foot square wooden platform is attached on a large tree, or raised on piles over the soil enabling to build on it. The platform can be built up to 10 feet high and includes a simple wooden staircase to access the platform.
**Spike barrier.** A 10-feet long barrier with many wooden or bone spikes. The area covered by the barrier is considered difficult terrain. Any creature that moves through the spike wall must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 10) or take ld4 piercing damage. The barrier has an AC 15,15 hit points and a damage threshold of 5.
**Stone Wall** A stone wall is a 15-feet long, 6 feet tall wall made from brick-and-mortar, used as a defensive structure or enclosure. Each 5 feet of wall has an AC 17, 30 hit points and a damage threshold of 10.

Some of this upgrades might not available to build in certain terrains due the type of materials needed For example, a spike barrier might be hard to craft in a desert since it requires wood or large bones.

#### ADDITIONAL FEATURES
While the upgrading features covers the most basic and generic ones, you can also create new ones, such as a clay oven, wooden furniture and such for creating a survival-themed campaign.


## Getting Lost

The characters might become lost. Explorers who are following a road or some other form of path or trail can’t become lost in normal circumstances.

If the characters might become lost, make note of the Wisdom (Survival] check result of any character who chose navigating during the current exploration turn (or the highest result, if more than one character performed this task]. If no one did so, treat the check result as 0. The DC for this check corresponds to the readiness of the group, as determined by its travel pace, plus a modifier based on the terrain (see the table].

If any character performed mapmaking as a task during the current exploration turn, the DC is reduced by 5.

Terrain	| DC Modifier
---------|--------------
Forest, swamp, jungle, mountains	| +5
Light forest jungle, hills, desert, tundra	| 0
Plains, prairie	| -5

Success. If the navigator’s Wisdom (Survival] check succeeds, the characters successfully travel the distance and in the direction they want.

Failure. If the check fails, the characters inadvertently travel in the wrong direction. Halfway through their travel in the current turn, you roll a d4 to determine how the group has deviated from its intended course.

d4 | Deviation
------|------
1	| 90 degrees left
2	| 45 degrees left
3	| 45 degrees right
4	| 90 degrees right


For example, for a group intending to move north, a roll of 1 indicates that the characters are now actually heading west; a roll of 3 means that their course has (unknown to them] shifted to the northeast.

This change of direction applies only to the characters’ travel during the last half of the current turn. On the next turn, if the chance of getting lost still exists, the characters make another check. If that check fails, they continue to be unaware of their change in heading. On a successful check, the characters realize they have moved off course and in what direction.

The characters might not realize they are lost unless they encounter an obstacle that indicates they are heading in the wrong direction. If the characters realize they have lost their way, you stop rolling for deviation in their course until they fail another check to avoid becoming lost.

### Заблудились

There are many ways to get lost in the wilderness. Following an obvious road, trail, or feature such as a stream or lakeshore prevents any possibility of becoming lost, but trav￾elers striking off cross-country may become disoriented—es￾pecially in conditions of poor visibility or in difficult terrain.

**Poor Visibility:** Any time characters cannot see at least 60 feet in the prevail￾ing conditions of visibility, they may be￾come lost. Characters traveling through fog, snow, or a downpour might easily lose the ability to see any landmarks not in their immediate vicinity. Similarly, characters travel￾ing at night may be at risk, too, de￾pending on the quality of their light sources, the amount of moonlight, and whether or not they have dark￾vision or low-light vision.

**Difficult Terrain:** Any character in forest, moor, hill, or mountain terrain may become lost if he or she moves away from a trail, road, stream, or other obvious path or track.

**Chance to Get Lost:** If conditions exist that make getting lost a possibility, the character leading the way must succeed at a Wilderness Lore check or become lost. The difficulty of this check varies based on the terrain, the visibility condi￾tions, and whether or not the character has a map of the area being traveled through.

Check once per hour (or portion of an hour) spent in local or overland movement to see if travelers have become lost.

In the case of a party moving together, only the character leading the way makes the check. (DM Tip: Make this check in secret, since the characters may not realize that they’re lost right away.)

Effects of Being Lost: If a party becomes lost, it is no longer certain of moving in the direction it intended to travel.

Randomly determine the direction the party actually travels in during each hour of local or overland movement. The char￾acters’ movement continues to be random until they blunder into a landmark they can’t miss, or until they recognize that they are lost and make an effort to regain their bearings.

Recognizing that You’re Lost: Once per hour of random travel, each character in the party may attempt a Wilderness Lore check (DC 20 –1 per hour of random travel) to recognize that they are no longer certain of their direction of travel. Some circumstances may make it obvious that the characters are lost; if they expected to reach a certain spot within an hour but three or four hours pass by with no sign of their destination, that’s a bad sign.

Setting a New Course: A lost party is also uncertain of determin￾ing in which direction it should travel in order to reach a desired objective—even an objective such as “the point where we left the road and went off into these dratted woods.” Determining the correct direction of travel once a party has become lost re￾quires a Wilderness Lore check (DC 15 +2 per hour of random travel). If a character fails in this

check, he chooses a random direction as the “correct” direction for resuming travel. (DM Tip: Again, this is a check you should make in secret. The lost characters may think they know the way to travel after regaining their bearings, but could be entirely wrong again.) Once the characters are traveling along their new course, correct or incorrect, it’s entirely possible for them to get lost again. If the conditions still make it possible for travelers to become lost, check once per hour of travel as described under Chance to Get Lost to see if the party maintains its new course, or begins to move at random again.

Conflicting Directions: It’s possible that several characters may attempt to determine the right direction to proceed after becoming lost. That’s just fine. The DM makes a Wil￾derness Lore check for each character in secret, then tells the players whose characters succeeded the correct direction to travel, and tells the players whose characters failed a random direction they think is right. (DM Tip: A few extraneous die rolls behind your screen might make it less apparent which characters are right and which characters are wrong.)

Regaining Your Bearings: There are several ways to be￾come un-lost. First, if the characters successfully set a new course and follow it to the destination they’re trying to reach, they’re not lost anymore. Second, the characters through random movement might run into an unmistakable landmark. Third, if conditions suddenly improve—the fog lifts, the sun comes up, or the travelers use know direction to ascertain the correct direction of north—lost characters may attempt to set a new course, as described above, with a +4 bonus on the Wilderness Lore check. Finally, more powerful magic such as find the path may make their course clear.

**Extreme Cold**

Whenever the temperature is at or below 0 degrees Fahrenheit, a creature exposed to the cold must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour or gain one level of exhaustion. Creatures with resistance or immunity to cold damage automatically succeed on the saving throw and creatures naturally adapted to cold climates.

*Cold weather outfit gives advantage on this check.*

**Extreme Heat**

When the temperature is at or above 100 degrees Fahrenheit, a creature exposed to the heat and without access to drinkable water must succeed on a Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour or gain one level of exhaustion. The DC is 5 for the first hour and increases by 1 for each additional hour.

Creatures wearing medium or heavy armor, or who are clad in heavy clothing, have disadvantage on the saving throw. Creatures with resistance or immunity to fire damage automatically succeed on the saving throw, as do creatures naturally adapted to hot climates.

**Strong Wind**
A strong wind imposes disadvantage on ranged weapon attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing. A strong wind also extinguishes open flames, disperses fog, and makes flying by nonmagical means nearly impossible. A flying creature in a strong wind must land at the end of its turn or fall.

A strong wind in a desert can create a sandstorm that imposes disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

**Heavy Precipitation**

Everything within an area of heavy rain or heavy snowfall is lightly obscured, and creatures in the area have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. Heavy rain also extinguishes open flames and imposes disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing.

**High Altitude**

Traveling at altitudes of 10,000 feet or higher above sea level is taxing for a creature that needs to breathe, because of the reduced amount of oxygen in the air. Each hour such a creature spends traveling at high altitude counts as 2 hours for the purpose of determining how long that creature can travel.

Breathing creatures can become acclimated to a high altitude by spending 30 days or more at this elevation. Breathing creatures can't become acclimated to elevations above 20,000 feet unless they are native to such environments.

## Wilderness Hazards

This section describes a few examples of hazards that adventurers might encounter in the wilderness.

Some hazards, such as slippery ice and razorvine, require no ability check to spot. Others, such as defiled ground, are undetectable by normal senses.

The other hazards presented here can be identified with a successful Intelligence (Nature) check. Use the guidelines in chapter 8 to set an appropriate DC for any check made to spot or recognize a hazard.

### Desecrated Ground

Some cemeteries and catacombs are imbued with the unseen traces of ancient evil. An area of desecrated ground can be any size, and a detect evil and good spell cast within range reveals its presence.

Undead standing on desecrated ground have advantage on all saving throws.

A vial of holy water purifies a 10-foot-square area of desecrated ground when sprinkled on it, and a hallow spell purifies desecrated ground within its area.

### Frigid Water

A creature can be immersed in frigid water for a number of minutes equal to its Constitution score before suffering any ill effects. Each additional minute spent in frigid water requires the creature to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion. Creatures with resistance or immunity to cold damage automatically succeed on the saving throw, as do creatures that are naturally adapted to living in ice-cold water.

### Quicksand

A quicksand pit covers the ground in roughly a 10-foot square area and is usually 10 feet deep. When a creature enters the area, it sinks 1d4+1 feet into the quicksand and becomes restrained. At the start of each of the creature's turns, it sinks another 1d4 feet. As long as the creature isn't completely submerged in quicksand, it can escape by using its action and succeeding on a Strength check. The DC is 10 plus the number of feet the creature has sunk into the quicksand. A creature that is completely submerged in quicksand can't breathe (see the suffocation rules in the Player's Handbook).

A creature can pull another creature within its reach out of a quicksand pit by using its action and succeeding on a Strength check. The DC is 5 plus the number of feet the target creature has sunk into the quicksand.

### Razorvine

Razorvine is a plant that grows in wild tangles and hedges. It also clings to the sides of buildings and other surfaces as ivy does. A 10-foot-high, 10-foot-wide, 5-foot-thick wall or hedge of razorvine has AC 11, 25 hit points, and immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and psychic damage.

When a creature comes into direct contact with razorvine for the first time on a turn, the creature must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or take 5 (1d10) slashing damage from the razorvine's bladelike thorns.

### Slippery Ice

Slippery ice is difficult terrain. When a creature moves onto slippery ice for the first time on a turn, it must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or fall prone.

### Thin Ice

Thin ice has a weight tolerance of 3d10 × 10 pounds per 10-foot-square area. Whenever the total weight on an area of thin ice exceeds its tolerance, the ice in that area breaks. All creatures on broken ice fall through.

## ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS

In this section you can find new environmental hazards, which follows similar rules as traps or lair actions. To determine the DC and damage, use the following tables

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Danger level | d20
--------|---------
Setback | 1-11
Dangerous	| 12-15	
Deadly | 16-20	

**DAMAGE SEVERITY BY LEVEL**

Character Level | Setback	| Dangerous	| Deadly
1st-4th	| IdlO	2dl 0	4dl 0
5th-1Oth|2d10|4d10|lOdlO
I "Ith-I 6th	4d10	lOdlO|18dl 0
I 7th-20th | 10d10 | 18dl0 | 24d19


### AVALANCHES, ROCKFALLS AND MUDSLIDES
*Any Level of Hazard*

Any character in the area where the hazard occurs must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes bludgeoning damage and is buried by the hazard, or half as much damage on a successful one. The area is filled with snow, rubble or mud and becomes difficult terrain.
Any buried creature is considered suffocated, and it can dig through to free itself. To do so, the creature must succeed a number of Strength (Athletics) checks, as shown in the following table.

Hazard Level | Number of Checks
Setback	| 2
Dangerous	| 3
Deadly | 4

### HAILSTORM
*Dangerous Hazard*

Similar to a blizzard, the terrain affected by the hailstorm is considered difficult terrain. When a creature without proper shelter is in the area affected by the hailstorm for one hour, it must make a Constitution saving throw, taking cold damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.


A cloud of swarming insects fills a 20-foot-radius sphere. The swarm moves at 20 feet on each round When a creature enters the cloud it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes piercing damage, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the cloud must roll another saving throw. A creature cannot be damaged by the insect swarm if it’s wielding a torch or if it is at least 5 feet from a fire.

### BLIZZARD
*Setback Hazard*

The area affected by a blizzard is considered difficult terrain. When a creature without proper shelter is in the area affected by the blizzard for one hour, it must make a Constitution saving throw, taking cold damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. If a creature is wearing warm clothing, it has advantage on the saving throw.

### EARTHQUAKES
*Any Level of Hazard*

A tremor shakes the area; each creature on the ground in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.
The hazard level is determined by the proximity to the epicenter or the intensity of the earth tremor:
•	Setback. Far from the epicenter or light earthquake.
•	Dangerous. Near the epicenter or moderate earthquake.
•	Deadly. Very close to the epicenter or severe earthquake.

### ELEMENTAL CLOUD
*Any Level of Hazard*

This cloud is made with elemental essence. When a creature enters the cloud, it must make an appropriate saving throw, taking damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the cloud must roll another saving throw./

Cloud Color	Damage Type	Saving Throw
Black	Necrotic	Constitution
Cyan	Cold	Constitution
Gray and Yellow	Lightning	Dexterity
Light Green	Acid	Constitution
Purple	Psychic	Wisdom
Red	Fire	Constitution
White	Force	Intelligence

### LAVA
*Deadly Hazard*

The lava is considered difficult terrain. Any creature that enters the lava takes fire damage. A creature that ends its turn in the lava takes fire damage. 

### LIGHTNING STORMS
*Dangerous or Deadly Hazard*

The DM rolls a dlOO to determine if any creature is hit by a lightning.
This check can be made at the beginning of each turn during a combat or in any time while the party is not in combat.
dlOO | Number of Creatures
-----------|--------------
1-50 | 0
51-70 | ld4
71-20 | 1d6
81-90	| 1d8
91-100 | 1d10

The creatures hit by a lightning are determined by the DM, and any creature in the area under total cover from above cannot take damage.

### MAGMA ERUPTIONS
*Dangerous Hazard*

Magma erupts from a point on the ground, creating a 20-foot- high, 5-foot-radius geyser. Each creature in the geyser's area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

### ROGUE WAVE
*Dangerous Hazard*

### POISON CLOUDS AND SPORES

Setback Hazard
When a creature enters the cloud, it must make a Constitution saving throw, taking poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the cloud must make another saving throw.

## DANGEROUS TERRAINS

In the following section you can find survival considerations and hazards for various terrains. You can combine different terrains to create a more dynamic (and probably more deadly) environment.

### ARCTIC

Cold and Extreme Cold The temperatures in this environment are lower than other places, and you need proper gear for resisting this temperatures. Whenever the temperature is at or below 0 degrees Fahrenheit, you must follow the rules of extreme cold

Food Scarcity. It's hard to find food like plants and creatures due the low temperatures. All the checks for foraging and hunting have a DC equal to 20.

Shelter. In general, the arctic areas are vast frozen plains with big glaciers and rocks, making it difficult to find a natural shelter.

ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS

Hazard  | Source | Notes
-----------|-------------|-------------
Avalanches	| CAW, P.5 5 | Only near mountains
Blizzard	| CAW, P.5 5 | 
Elemental Cloud	| CAW. 5 5 | Cyan clouds only
Frigid Water	| DMG, P.110|
Hailstorm	| CAW, P.5 5| 
Chasms and Ice Cracks	| DMG, P.l 22 | Use the pits trap
Slippery Ice	| DMG, P.110 |
Thin Ice	| DMG, P.lll |



### CAVES


Darkness and Light. Most of the natural caves don't have light sources, so anyone who enters must bring their sources of light and fire for warmth, cooking and in some cases, defense. A caves might have some light sources, such as groups of fluorescent fungus or other dangerous light sources, like lava.

Orientation and tracking. Inside a cave it's almost impossible to determine where's North: lots of caves are just tunnels connected, making it more difficult to create an accurate map of it.

Flooding. Some parts of the caves might be close to a water source or any other liquid that can quickly fill a room.

ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS

Earthquakes	CAW, P.5 5	Might cause rockfalls
Elemental Cloud	CAW, P.5 5	
Lava	CAW, P.5 5	
Pits	DMG, P.122	
Rockfalls	CAW, P.5 5	
Unsteady Ground	CAW, P.56	


### DESERT		


Heat and Extreme Heat. The opposite of the arctic terrain, temperatures in this environment are higher than other places, and you need enough water supplies for resisting the heat. Whenever the temperature is at or above 100 degrees Fahrenheit, you must follow the rules of extreme heat.

Shelter. In general, the desert areas are just sand and rocks (in some areas they might be some scattered shrubs) making it difficult to find a safe campsite.

Strong Wind A strong wind imposes disadvantage on ranged weapon attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing. A strong wind also extinguishes open flames, disperses fog, and makes flying by nonmagical means nearly impossible. A flying creature in a strong wind must land at the end of its turn or fall A strong wind in a desert can create a sandstorm that imposes disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

Water Scarcity. Finding water in a desert is extremely difficult, unless you're near an Oasis. All checks made for getting water have a DC equal to 20.

Hazard	Source	Notes
Earthquakes	CAW, P.5 5	
Elemental Cloud	CAW, P.5 5	Mostly red clouds
Lightning Storms	CAW, P.56

### FORESTS AND JUNGLES

Density. Sometimes is hard to walk through a forest due the great number of plants, trees and vegetation. In most of the cases, you can't walk in a straight line through the forest. Orientation and tracking. Inside a forest, the trees covers the sky, making it hard to determine where's North, and depending the density of the forest it might be harder to keep a track.

Sight and hearing. It might be more difficult to see or hear your surroundings because the density of the forest, the tree shadows, obstacles (such a fallen tree) and the sound of the trees and vegetation moving with the wind

### LAKES, RIVERS AND OCEAN


Orientation and tracking. In the middle of the ocean or under a storm, it's difficult to determine the cardinal points without the proper tools.
Shipwrecks. In the ocean, lakes and even in rivers there're rocks, icebergs, and more that can damage or destroy a ship or boat.
Water streams. The river streams can change drastically depending on the terrain around the rivers, like the terrain elevation, inclination and waterfalls.

Rapids	CAW, P.56	Rivers only
Rogue Wave	CAW, P.56	Ocean only

### MOUNTAINS		


Altitude. When you're traveling at altitudes of 10,000 feet or higher above sea level, you must follow the high altitude rules. 

Strong wind A strong wind imposes disadvantage on ranged weapon attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing. A strong wind also extinguishes open flames, disperses fog, and makes flying by nonmagical means nearly impossible. A flying creature in a strong wind must land at the end of its turn or fall A strong wind in a desert can create a sandstorm that imposes disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

HIGH ALTITUDE (DMC, P.110)
Traveling at altitudes of 1 0,000 feet or higher above sea level is taxing for a creature that needs to breathe, because of the reduced amount of oxygen in the air. Each hour such a creature spends traveling at high altitude counts as 2 hours for the purpose of determining how long that creature can travel.

Breathing creatures can become acclimated to a high altitude by spending 30 days or more at this elevation. Breathing creatures can't become acclimated to elevations above 20,000 feet unless they are native to such environments.

Lightning Storms	CAW, P.5 6
Magma Eruptions	CAW, P.56 Near Volcanoes
Unsteady Ground	CAW, P.5 6



### SWAMPS

Clean water. Swamps are characterized by having slow- moving and stagnant waters, being harder to find drinkable water. Drinking stagnant water might cause diseases. Warmth. The swamps are wet and soggy, so finding dry resources for making a fire it's almost impossible.

Low visibility. Mist, fog and lowlands are common in this terrain, and they reduces the visibility of any creature.

### SPECIAL TERRAINS
In the wilderness, there're places that have been touched by ancient magic or energies for centuries, creating a persistent effect on those lands. Here're some ideas for creating special terrains you can add to flesh a particular zone in the wild

#### BLOOD ROCK
This area was part of old and forgotten ceremonial sacrifices, a massive battle between armies that fought for centuries or the place where a powerful otherwordly creature was slain. The area is covered by stones with a red tone, bones covered by dirt and mud and dry blood Any creature standing in this area can score a critical hit on a 19 or 20.
Long-Term Effect: A creature must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw at the end of each hour. On a failed save, the creature must use its action each round to attack the nearest creature it sees. At the end of each of its turns, the creature can make a new Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the effect ends until another hour passes.

#### DEATH CIRCLE RUINS
This area surrounded by dark stone pillars is infused with necrotic energy. Any healing effect, such as a cure wounds spell only heals half the total amount in this area.
Long-Term Effect: A living creature must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour. On a failed save, its hit point maximum is reduced by ld6. To recover the reduced hit points, the creature must spend 1 hour outside the area covered by the death circle ruins.

#### DEFILED GROUND
The dark energy fills this area, attracting undead creatures to this area. Any undead creature gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls while standing in the defiled ground Additionally, when an undead is reduced to 0 hit points, roll a d20. On a 10 or higher, the undead creature rises with 1 hit point on its next turn. If an undead is reduced to 0 hit points by radiant damage, it cannot roll for rising again.
Long-Term Effect: A creature must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour. On a failed save, it takes 5 necrotic damage.

#### GRAB GRASS
This thick, tough grass grows in areas constantly touched by Feywild magic that clings to characters and creatures that falls prone. An area covered by grab grass is considered difficult terrain, and any creature that falls prone in this area must make a Strength (Athletics) check to stand up (DC 10)

#### LIFE CIRCLE RUINS
This area surrounded by white stone pillars is infused with pure life energy. Every 1 minute, any living creature that begins its turn in the area regains 2 hit points.
Long-Term Effect: Any living creature that stays in this area for 1 hour can end either one disease or one condition afflicting it. The condition can be blinded, deafened, paralyzed or poisoned

#### PLANETOUCHED
Due to planar energy, a powerful artifact or some other factor, this terrain boosts certain types of energy related to one plane. Pick one damage type from the following list: Acid Cold Fire, Force, Lightning, Necrotic, Psychic or Radiant. Any attack that deals the chosen damage type deals an extra ld6 damage of that type.

#### SACRED SHRINE
A sacred shrine is dedicated to a particular deity, infusing with divine energy the area nearby. A creature that shares the deity's alignment gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls while standing in the area covered by the shrine.
Long-Term Effect: A creature that has a different alignment to the deity's alignment must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw at the end of each hour. On a failed save, it has disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures that shares the deity's alignment. At the end of each of its turns, the creature can make a new Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the effect ends until another hour passes.







# Дикая местность

Всякий раз, когда персонажи покидают относитель¬ную безопасность Смертельных Снегов и путешествуют на большие расстояния, они подвергаются жестоким погодным условиям и опасным чудовищам диких мест. Смертельные Снега и земли на севере рассматриваются как открытая местность с целью определения случайной погоды (смотрите Главу 2), в то время как большинство других мест в городке и вокруг него считаются альпийскими областями.

С целью столкновений в дикой местности при¬нимайте Смертельные Снега и земли севернее как часть Лунных Земель, Долины Адбар и региона Холодной Долины (**Таблица 2)**. Очевидно, что любой идущий в горы, окружающие город, путешествует через Незерийские Горы (**Таблица 6**). Некоторые из случайных столкновений в дикой местности могут быть смертельными для партий среднего уровня. Шанс столкновения в течение каждого часа путешествия зависит от старания персонажей идти быстро или осторожно, смотрите Столкновения в дикой местности в Главе 2.

Никаких столкновений в дикой местности не происходит в пределах 2 миль от городских стен в тече¬ние дня или в пределах 1 мили - ночью или в плохую погоду. Даже чудища обходят городок стороной, если не ищут себе неприятностей.

# Natural Hazards

Hungry monsters and rapacious brigands occupy the thoughts of many travelers in the North, but in truth these are not the deadliest dangers of this harsh land. Everyday oc￾currences such as a bitter cold snap in winter, an ill-timed snowfall, a forest fire, or a river in flood kill just as many travelers and homesteaders in the Silver Marches as mon￾sters do, and certainly have the potential to inflict much greater damage to property.

## AVALANCHES AND LANDSLIDES

The combination of high mountains and heavy snowfalls means that avalanches are a deadly peril in many areas around the North. The Lands Against the Wall, the Spine of the World, the Rauvin Mountains, and the passes through the Nether Mountains are particularly vulnerable. (Ironically, the Ice Mountains are not so dangerous, since they see less snowfall than their neighbors to the west.) If the snowpack is not high, death can still come hurtling down in the form of a landslide. The extremes of temperature common to the North fiercely weather the sides of mountains and cause many falling rocks throughout the year.

The effects of avalanches and landslides are described in The Environment in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide. The typical avalanche or landslide has a width of 1d6×100 feet, from one edge of the slide zone to the oppo￾site edge. The bury zone in the center of the avalanche is half as wide as the avalanche’s full width. To determine the pre￾cise location of characters in the path of an avalanche, roll 1d6×20; the result is the number of feet from the center of the path taken by the bury zone to the center of the party’s location. Avalanches advance at a speed of 500 feet per round, landslides at a speed of 250 feet per round.

## THE CLAWS OF THE COLD

Even in the summertime, the mountain passes and high slopes plummet below freezing at night. Most old hands in the Silver Marches own a good set of winter clothing, and are wise enough to stay out of the sort of weather winter clothing won’t help against.

For the effect of cold and extremely cold weather condi￾tions on characters and creatures, see Weather and Cold Dan￾gers, both in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide.

Cold Water: Characters who become soaked or drenched in cold water (usually by immersion in a mountain stream, but marching in a downpour can do the job) are much more vulnerable to cold damage. Moderate temperatures are treated as cold conditions and cold temperatures are treated as extremely cold conditions for purposes of determining whether a soaked character is vulnerable to cold damage.

This vulnerability remains for 2d4 hours or until a character changes into dry clothes. Soaked clothing provides no protec￾tion against cold damage.

Characters who remain immersed in cold water take 1d6 points of subdual damage per minute of exposure from hy￾pothermia.

Permafrost: North of the Sundabar Vale, permafrost con￾ditions prevail. Even in summer, the ground remains frozen hard a foot or so beneath the surface, except around sun￾warmed rocks. Buried corpses and food in contact with per￾mafrost will freeze (though stone cairns are necessary to keep scavengers away), and ready ice is always handy.

Frozen Lakes and Rivers: During winter, most bodies of water in the Silver Marches freeze over. Most years, the freeze comes in the month of Marpenoth, beginning 1d10+20 days into the month. The ice lasts until the month of Ches, disappearing 1d10+20 days into the month. The thickness of the ice depends on the month and whether or not the water is flowing:

| Month     | Standing Water | Flowing Water |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|
| Marpenoth | Thin           | —             |
|           |                |               |
| Uktar     | Moderate       | Thin          |
|           |                |               |
| Nightal   | Thick          | Moderate      |
|           |                |               |
| Hammer    | Thick          | Thick         |
|           |                |               |
| Alturiak  | Thick          | Thick         |
|           |                |               |
| Ches      | Thin           | Thin          |

Thin ice is 1 to 2 inches thick. It supports Small creatures. Medium-size creatures that run, jump, fall, or fight on the ice may cause a break (50% chance per round of such activity).

Moderate ice is 3 to 11 inches thick. It supports Large crea￾tures. Huge creatures that run, jump, fall, or fight on the ice may cause a break (50% chance per round of such activity).

Thick ice may be anywhere from 1 to 4 feet thick. It sup￾ports creatures of any size. Ice has 3 hit points per inch of thickness. If a creature too heavy for the ice causes a break, the ice collapses in a circle whose radius is 5 feet larger than the face (or dimensions) of the creature causing the break. Any creature caught in the fracture area except for the creature causing the break may attempt a Reflex save (DC 15) to reach safe ice before it gives way.

Thin ice is particularly dangerous, because the edges of a fractured area tend to crumble under a swimmer’s efforts to climb out. To climb out, a Small or Medium-size swimmer must succeed at an Escape Artist check (DC 15). Large crea￾tures can’t get back on top of thin ice after it fractures.

Frozen rivers are dangerous, too. Creatures who fall through the ice of a frozen river may be swept away from the hole by the current and trapped under the ice. Apply the drowning rule (see Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide) as necessary.  FOREST FIRES

Most campfire sparks ignite nothing, but if conditions are dry, winds are strong, or the forest floor is dried out and flammable, a forest fire can result. Lightning strikes often set trees afire and start forest fires in this way. Luckily, the lands of the Silver Marches are almost always damp. Small “scorch-smolders” of blackened vegetation are the usual result, not conflagrations that spread for miles. Yet travelers can get caught in fires. The leading edge of a fire (the downwind side) can advance faster than a human can run (assume 120 feet per round for winds of moderate strength). Once a particular portion of the forest is ablaze, it re￾mains so for 2d4×10 minutes before dying to a smolder. Within the bounds of a forest fire, a character faces three dangers: heat damage, catching on fire, and smoke inhalation.

**Heat:** Getting caught within a forest fire is even worse than being exposed to abysmal heat (see Heat Dangers in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide). Breathing the air causes a character to take 1d6 points of damage per round (no save). In addition, a character must make a Fortitude save every 5 rounds (DC 15, +1 per previous check) or sustain 1d4 points of subdual damage. A character who holds his breath can avoid the normal damage, but not the subdual damage.

**Catching on Fire:** Characters engulfed in a forest fire are at risk of catching on fire when the leading edge of the fire overtakes them, and are then at risk once per minute thereafter. See Catch￾ing on Fire in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide.

**Smoke:** Forest fires naturally produce a great deal of smoke. A character who breathes heavy smoke must make a Fortitude saving throw each round (DC 15, +1 per previous check) or spend that round choking and coughing. A charac￾ter who chokes for two consecutive rounds takes 1d6 points of subdual damage. Also, smoke obscures vision, giving one￾half concealment (20% miss chance) to characters within it.

## FLOODS

In locales throughout the Silver Marches where heavy pre￾cipitation and steep slopes prevail, floods are common.

**Rivers in Flood:** In spring, the enormous snowmelt from the slopes of the Nether and Rauvin mountains engorges most of the streams and rivers in and around the Silver Marches. During spring flood, rivers become wider, deeper, and swifter. Assume that a river rises by 1d10+10 feet during the spring flood, and its width increases by a factor of 1d4×50%. Fords may disappear for days, bridges may be swept away, and even ferries might not be able to manage the crossing of a flooded river.A river in flood adds +5 to the DC of any Swim checks that characters attempt. For example, Striding Giant Rapids on the Rauvin might normally be considered rough water (see the Swim skill description in Chapter 4 of the Player’s Hand￾book), which means that Swim checks to get across the river are against DC 15. When this area is in spring flood, the DC rises to 20. (The increase in water depth may make fords too deep for most travelers to wade successfully, so swimming may be their best option if crossing the river is necessary.)

**Mountain Torrent:** Innumerable swift, strong streams cascade down out of the mountains of the Silver Marches in all seasons. In general, the typical mountain torrent is 5d6 feet in width and studded with boulders. Waterfalls 1d6×10 feet in height occur every 1d4 miles. Unlucky or clumsy characters may find themselves in a fast-moving gauntlet of icy water, deadly rocks, and sudden waterfalls. Refer to Water Dangers in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide. Characters swept away by the torrent must attempt Swim checks (DC 15) every round to avoid going under. If a character gets a skill check result of 5 or more over the minimum necessary, he arrests his motion by catching a rock, tree limb, or bottom snag—he is no longer being carried along by the flow of the water. Escaping a torrent by reaching the bank requires three suc￾cessful Swim checks (DC 15) in a row. Characters arrested by a rock, limb, or snag can’t escape unless they strike out into the water and attempt to swim their way clear.

**Flash Floods:** These sudden, short-lived torrents occur after heavy rains or ice breakups in spring. A flash flood typically lasts only 4d4 minutes before the waters recede.  Flash floods advance at a speed of 60 feet. See Flash Floods under Weather Hazards in Chapter 3 of the DUN￾GEON MASTER’s Guide.  FOG

The forgotten peril of the North is its everpresent river mist and mountain fog. Characters traveling along a river by boat  can’t get too lost, of course. However, fogbound overland travel offers a real possibility of running into trees, gullies, and other hazards. A typical fog limits vision to a distance of 1d10×5 feet, completely foiling normal vision and darkvi￾sion beyond this range. Creatures closer than the absolute limit of visibility gain the benefits of one-half concealment (20% miss chance).  

##  Encountering Hazards

An encounter with a natural hazard in motion, such as an avalanche or a forest fire, begins in a particular way de￾pending on the type of hazard.

**Avalanche/Landslide:** An avalanche or landslide can be spotted from as far away as 1d10×500 feet by a character who makes a successful Spot check (DC 20). The DC of the Spot check is modified by any of the conditions that apply from Table 3–2 in the DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide. (Con￾sider the avalanche to be a Colossal encounter, meaning that the DC is immediately reduced by 16.) If all charac￾ters fail their Spot checks to determine the encounter dis￾tance, the avalanche moves closer to them, and they automatically become aware of it when it closes to half the original distance.

It’s possible to hear an avalanche coming even if you can’t see it. Under optimum conditions (no other loud noises occurring), a character who makes a successful Listen check (DC 15) can hear the avalanche or landslide when it is 1d6×500 feet away. This check might have a DC of 20, 25, or higher in conditions where hearing is difficult (such as in the middle of a thunderstorm).

**Forest Fire:** A forest fire can be spotted from as far away as 2d6×100 feet by a character who makes a success￾ful Spot check (DC 20). The DC of the Spot check is modi￾fied by any of the conditions that apply from Table 3–2 in the DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide. (Consider the fire to be a Colossal encounter, meaning that the DC is immediately reduced by 16.) If all characters fail their Spot checks to determine the encounter distance, the fire moves closer to them, and they automatically see it when it closes to half the original distance.Characters who are blinded or otherwise unable to make Spot checks can feel the heat of the fire (and thus auto￾matically “spot” it) when it is 100 feet away.

# Natural Hazards

Hungry monsters and rapacious brigands occupy the thoughts of many travelers in the North, but in truth these are not the deadliest dangers of this harsh land. Everyday oc￾currences such as a bitter cold snap in winter, an ill-timed snowfall, a forest fire, or a river in flood kill just as many travelers and homesteaders in the Silver Marches as mon￾sters do, and certainly have the potential to inflict much
greater damage to property.

## AVALANCHES AND LANDSLIDES

The combination of high mountains and heavy snowfalls means that avalanches are a deadly peril in many areas around the North. The Lands Against the Wall, the Spine of the World, the Rauvin Mountains, and the passes through the Nether Mountains are particularly vulnerable. (Ironically, the Ice Mountains are not so dangerous, since they see less snowfall than their neighbors to the west.) If the snowpack is not high, death can still come hurtling down in the form of a landslide. The extremes of temperature common to the North fiercely weather the sides of mountains and cause many falling rocks throughout the year.
The effects of avalanches and landslides are described in The Environment in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide. The typical avalanche or landslide has a width of 1d6×100 feet, from one edge of the slide zone to the oppo￾site edge. The bury zone in the center of the avalanche is half
as wide as the avalanche’s full width. To determine the pre￾cise location of characters in the path of an avalanche, roll 1d6×20; the result is the number of feet from the center of the path taken by the bury zone to the center of the party’s location. Avalanches advance at a speed of 500 feet per round, landslides at a speed of 250 feet per round. 

## THE CLAWS OF THE COLD

Even in the summertime, the mountain passes and high slopes plummet below freezing at night. Most old hands in the Silver Marches own a good set of winter clothing, and are wise enough to stay out of the sort of weather winter clothing won’t help against.

For the effect of cold and extremely cold weather condi￾tions on characters and creatures, see Weather and Cold Dan￾gers, both in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide.
**Cold Water:** Characters who become soaked or drenched in cold water (usually by immersion in a mountain stream, but marching in a downpour can do the job) are much more vulnerable to cold damage. Moderate temperatures are treated as cold conditions and cold temperatures are treated as extremely cold conditions for purposes of determining whether a soaked character is vulnerable to cold damage.

This vulnerability remains for 2d4 hours or until a character changes into dry clothes. Soaked clothing provides no protec￾tion against cold damage.ake 1d6 points of subdual damage per minute of exposure from hy￾pothermia.Permafrost: North of the Sundabar Vale, permafrost con￾ditions prevail. Even in summer, the ground remains frozen hard a foot or so beneath the surface, except around sun￾warmed rocks. Buried corpses and food in contact with per￾mafrost will freeze (though stone cairns are necessary to keep scavengers away), and ready ice is always handy.
Frozen Lakes and Rivers: During winter, most bodies of water in the Silver Marches freeze over. Most years, the freeze comes in the month of Marpenoth, beginning 1d10+20 days into the month. The ice lasts until the month of Ches, disappearing 1d10+20 days into the month. The thickness of the ice depends on the month and whether or not the water is flowing: 


Month     | Standing Water | Flowing Water
----------|----------------|--------------
Marpenoth | Thin           | —
Uktar     | Moderate       | Thin
Nightal   | Thick          | Moderate
Hammer    | Thick          | Thick
Alturiak  | Thick          | Thick
Ches      | Thin           | Thin

Thin ice is 1 to 2 inches thick. It supports Small creatures. Medium-size creatures that run, jump, fall, or fight on the ice may cause a break (50% chance per round of such activity).
Moderate ice is 3 to 11 inches thick. It supports Large crea￾tures. Huge creatures that run, jump, fall, or fight on the ice may cause a break (50% chance per round of such activity).

Thick ice may be anywhere from 1 to 4 feet thick. It sup￾ports creatures of any size. Ice has 3 hit points per inch of thickness. If a creature too heavy for the ice causes a break, the ice collapses in a circle whose radius is 5 feet larger than the face (or dimensions) of the creature causing the break. Any creature caught in the fracture area except for the creature causing the break may attempt a Reflex save (DC 15) to reach safe ice before it gives way. 

Thin ice is particularly dangerous, because the edges of a fractured area tend to crumble under a swimmer’s efforts to climb out. To climb out, a Small or Medium-size swimmer must succeed at an Escape Artist check (DC 15). Large crea￾tures can’t get back on top of thin ice after it fractures.

Frozen rivers are dangerous, too. Creatures who fall through the ice of a frozen river may be swept away from the hole by the current and trapped under the ice. Apply the drowning rule (see Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide) as necessary.  

## FOREST FIRES

Most campfire sparks ignite nothing, but if conditions are dry, winds are strong, or the forest floor is dried out and flammable, a forest fire can result. Lightning strikes often set trees afire and start forest fires in this way. Luckily, the lands of the Silver Marches are almost always damp. Small “scorch-smolders” of blackened vegetation are the usual result, not conflagrations that spread for miles. Yet travelers can get caught in fires. The leading edge of a fire (the downwind side) can advance faster than a human can run (assume 120 feet per round for winds of moderate strength). Once a particular portion of the forest is ablaze, it re￾mains so for 2d4×10 minutes before dying to a smolder. Within the bounds of a forest fire, a character faces three dangers: heat damage, catching on fire, and smoke inhalation.

**Heat:** Getting caught within a forest fire is even worse than being exposed to abysmal heat (see Heat Dangers in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide). Breathing the air causes a character to take 1d6 points of damage per round (no save). In addition, a character must make a Fortitude save every 5 rounds (DC 15, +1 per previous check) or sustain 1d4 points of subdual damage. A character who holds his breath can avoid the normal damage, but not the subdual damage. 
Catching on Fire: Characters engulfed in a forest fire are at risk of catching on fire when the leading edge of the fire overtakes them, and are then at risk once per minute thereafter. See Catch￾ing on Fire in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide.

**Smoke: Forest** fires naturally produce a great deal of smoke. A character who breathes heavy smoke must make a Fortitude saving throw each round (DC 15, +1 per previous check) or spend that round choking and coughing. A charac￾ter who chokes for two consecutive rounds takes 1d6 points of subdual damage. Also, smoke obscures vision, giving one￾half concealment (20% miss chance) to characters within it.

Escaping a torrent by reaching the bank requires three suc￾cessful Swim checks (DC 15) in a row. Characters arrested by a rock, limb, or snag can’t escape unless they strike out into the water and attempt to swim their way clear.

**Flash Floods:** These sudden, short-lived torrents occur after heavy rains or ice breakups in spring. A flash flood typically lasts only 4d4 minutes before the waters recede.  Flash floods advance at a speed of 60 feet. See Flash Floods under Weather Hazards in Chapter 3 of the DUN￾GEON MASTER’s Guide. 

## FOG

The forgotten peril of the North is its everpresent river mist and mountain fog. Characters traveling along a river by boat  can’t get too lost, of course. However, fogbound overland travel offers a real possibility of running into trees, gullies, and other hazards. A typical fog limits vision to a distance of 1d10×5 feet, completely foiling normal vision and darkvi￾sion beyond this range. Creatures closer than the absolute limit of visibility gain the benefits of one-half concealment (20% miss chance).

## Путешествие по горам

High altitude can be extremely fatiguing—or sometimes deadly—to creatures that aren’t used to it. Cold becomes ex￾treme, and the lack of oxygen in the air can wear down even the most hardy of warriors.

Acclimated Characters: Creatures accustomed to high alti￾tude generally fare better than lowlanders. Any creature nor￾mally found in mountain terrain is considered native to the area, and acclimated to the high altitude. Characters with the Endurance feat, 4 ranks of Wilderness Lore, or 7 ranks of Climb are also acclimated to high altitude.

Undead, constructs, and other creatures that do not breathe are immune to altitude effects.

**Altitude Bands:** In general, mountains present three possi￾ble altitude bands: low pass, low peak/high pass, and high peak.

Low Pass (lower than 7,000 feet): Most travel in low mountains takes place in low passes. Travelers may find the going difficult (which is reflected in the movement modi￾fiers for traveling through mountains), but there are no un￾usual weather or altitude effects.

Low Peak or High Pass (7,000 to 20,000 feet): Ascending to the highest slopes of low mountains, or most normal travel through high mountains, falls into this category. At these ele￾vations, creatures may be subject to high altitude effects (see below). Temperatures at this level are one grade colder than the prevailing weather would indicate—for example, if the day’s temperature is moderate, it’s actually cold at this altitude.

High Peak (more than 20,000 feet): The highest slopes and peaks of high mountains exceed 20,000 feet in height. At these el￾evations, creatures may be subject to altitude sickness (see below).

Temperatures at this level are always two grades colder than the prevailing weather indicates—for example, if the day’s tempera￾ture is moderate, it’s actually extremely cold at this altitude.

High Altitude Effects: All nonacclimated creatures labor to breathe in the thin air at high altitude. See Lack of Air/High Altitude, under Other Dangers in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide. Acclimated characters are not subject to high altitude effects.

Altitude Sickness: Any creature at an altitude higher than 20,000 feet is subject to both high altitude effects and alti￾tude sickness, as described under Lack of Air/High Altitude in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide. Creatures acclimated to high altitude as described above receive a +4 bonus on their saving throws to resist high altitude effects and altitude sickness, but eventually even seasoned moun￾taineers must abandon these dangerous elevations.

## Зыбучие пески и топи

In moors, marshes, and other examples of sodden terrain, hidden, water-filled holes await the unwary. Obvious bogs are not very dangerous—everybody can recognize a mud￾hole or a scum-covered pond. However, some of these patches present a deceptively solid appearance and may trap careless characters. A character approaching a hidden bog or patch of quicksand at a normal pace is entitled to a Wilder￾ness Lore check (DC 8) to spot the danger before stepping in, but charging or running characters don’t have a chance to detect a hidden bog before blundering in. A typical patch of quicksand or quaking bog is (1d4+1)×5 feet in diameter; the momentum of a charging or running character carries him or her 1d2×5 feet into the bog.

**Effects of Quicksand:** Characters in quicksand must make a Swim check (DC 10) every round to simply tread water in place, or a Swim check (DC 15) to move 5 feet in whatever direction is desired. If a trapped character fails this check by 5 or more, he sinks below the surface and begins to drown whenever he can no longer hold his breath. Characters below the surface of a bog may swim back to the surface with a successful Swim check (DC 15 +1 per con￾secutive round of being under the surface).

Rescue: Pulling out a character trapped in quicksand can be difficult. A rescuer needs a branch, spear haft, rope, or similar tool that enables him to reach the victim with one end of it. Then he must make a Strength check (DC 15) to successfully pull the victim, and the victim must make a Strength check (DC 10) to hold onto the branch, pole, or rope. If the victim fails to hold on, he must make an imme￾diate Swim check (DC 15) to stay above the surface. If both checks succeed, the victim is pulled 5 feet closer to safety.

## RAIN, SNOW, SLEET, AND HAIL

Precipitation is a daily occurrence in the Silver Marches most of the year. Bad weather frequently slows or halts travel and makes it virtually impossible to navigate from one spot to another.

**Rain:** Rain is all too frequent in the North. Rain affects visibility, ranged attacks and Listen, Search, and Spot checks as described in Precipitation under Weather Hazards in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide. Characters caught out in steady rain become soaked in 2d6×10 minutes, which may make them more vulnerable to cold damage (see The Claws of the Cold earlier in this chapter).

**Downpours:** These sudden, heavy rains often cause flash floods in hilly or mountainous country. Downpours have all the properties of rain, except that visibility is reduced as de￾scribed below, and characters become soaked in 10 minutes, rendering them more susceptible to cold damage.

Visibility in a downpour is limited to a range of 1d10×5 feet. Creatures closer than the absolute limit of visibility gain one-half concealment (20% miss chance).

**Hail:** The effects of hail are described in Precipitation under Weather Hazards in Chapter 3 of the DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide. Hail in the North can be unusually heavy and dangerous—there is a 10% chance that the hail deals 1 point of damage to all creatures caught in the open, and if this happens, there’s a 20% chance that hailstones the size of a human fist (or bigger) fall. This extra-large hail deals 1d4 points of damage to any creature caught in the open. Fallen hail reduces movement by half, just like a fall of snow. In moderate or warm temperatures, it takes 1d4 hours for fallen hail to melt. In cold temperatures, hail remains on the ground for 4d4 hours.

**Sleet:** The ice storms of the North are legendary for their destructive power. Sleet has the same effects on visibility, ranged attacks, and Listen, Search, and Spot checks as rain, and reduces movement by half.

Sleet hisses as it falls, and coats everything with ice, creat￾ing slippery conditions for any skill checks affected by the conditions of the surface (Balance and Climb, for example). This slippery state lasts until snowfall covers the ice, or a thaw (one day of moderate or higher temperatures) melts it. In addition, sleet soaks characters in the open over the course of 2d6×10 minutes, making them more vulnerable to cold damage.

**Snow:** Falling snow has the same effects on visibility, ranged weapon attacks, and skill checks as rain, and reduces movement to half. A day of snowfall leaves 1d6 inches of snow on the ground. When the depth of the snow reaches half a creature’s height, movement is slowed to one-quarter normal, and when snow reaches a creature’s height, move￾ment is halved again.

Snow melts off at the rate of 4 inches per day of moder￾ate temperatures, 8 inches per day of warm temperatures, or 12 inches per day of hot temperatures.

**Heavy Snow:** Heavy snowfall has the same effects as normal snowfall, but also restricts visibility as fog does (see Fog, earlier in this section). A day of heavy snow leaves 1d3 feet of snow on the ground. Heavy snow accompanied by strong or severe winds may result in snowdrifts 1d4×5 feet in depth, especially in and around objects big enough to de￾flect the prevailing wind—a cabin or large tent, for instance. There is a 10% chance that a heavy snowfall is accompa￾nied by lightning (see below).

## LIGHTNING

Thunderstorms are common in the summer and early fall in the Silver Marches. A mountain thunderstorm is nothing to stand around and admire; it can be deadly. Lightning some￾times accompanies heavy snowfalls, too.

**Thunderstorms:** During a day in which thunderstorms appear, creatures in the open encounter 1d3 distinct storms. Each storm lasts for 2d6×10 minutes. There is a 20% chance per storm that a bolt endangers a creature or group of creatures in the open. Each lightning bolt inflicts 1d10 8-sided dice of damage in a 10-foot radius. Roll randomly to determine which char￾acter is at the center of the strike. Any threatened character (including the character at the center) is entitled to a Reflex save (DC 15) to take only half damage.

## SANDSTORMS

Thanks to the dampness of the North, duststorms are un￾known in these lands, but sandstorms—heavy particles driven by furious winds from Anauroch—occur from time to time.

They seldom reach west of Sundabar. Sandstorms reduce vis￾ibility to 1d10×5 feet and provide a –4 penalty on Listen, Search, and Spot checks. Sandstorms deal 1d3 points of subdual damage per hour to any creatures caught in the open, and leave a thin coating of sand (1d2 inches) in their wake.

For the race of the bandit group, roll d%: 01–10, dwarf; 11–70, human; 71–100, half-orc.

**Bugbear Band:** 1d10+10 bugbears, 1d3 bugbear warriors (level 1d3+1), and 1 bugbear fighter (level 1d4+3).

**Forest Fire:** In summer or fall, a forest fire endangers the characters. The fire covers a front 3d10×500 feet across, centered on the location of the party at the time the encounter was generated. See the Encountering Natural Hazards sidebar and Forest Fires, later in this chapter. In winter or spring, treat this as no encounter.

**Ghast Pack:** 1d3+1 **ghasts** and 1d6+1 **ghouls.**

**Ghost:**This encounter consists of 1d4 ghosts of level 1d4+2.

**Mountain Torrent:** The party encounters an unmarked stream in its path with no obvious means of crossing. There is a 50% chance that some kind of precarious crossing exists (a fallen log, or chain of boulders) that can be employed with a successful Balance check (DC 15). Failure on this check means that the character falls in the water and may be swept downstream; see Mountain Torrents under Floods in the following section. If the party is traveling along a road or trail, the stream is bridged in some fashion. Treat this as no encounter.

**NPCs:** The NPC party consists of 1d3+2 individuals (level 2d4). To determine the alignment, race, and class of each character, consult Tables 2–28 through 2–32 in the DUN￾GEON MASTER’s Guide, or use the corresponding tables in the FORGOTTEN REALMS DUNGEON MASTER’s Screen.

**Orc Marauders:** 1d10+5 **orcs,** 1d3+1 orc **berserkers** (level 1d3+1), and 1 orc **Eye of Gruumsh** accompanied by 1d2 dire boars.

**Orc Warband:** 1d10+10 orcs, 1d3 orc barbarians (level 1d3+1), 1d3 orc fighters (level 1d3+1), 1 orc adept (level 1d6), and 1 orc leader (level 1d3+3), accompanied by 1d2 dire boars. To determine the leader’s class, roll d%: 01–30, barbarian; 31–45, cleric; 46–80, fighter; 81–85, ranger; 86–90, rogue; 91–100, sorcerer.

**Uthgardt Scouts:** 1d4+2 tribal warriors and 1d2 leaders (level 1d6+1). For the leaders’ classes, roll d%: 01–50, barbarian; 51–65, cleric; 66–75, druid; 76–85, ranger; 86–90, rogue; 91–100, sorcerer. There is a 30% chance the group belongs to the Sky Pony tribe and is mounted. Uthgardt scouts are usually chaotic neutral.

**Vampire Troupe:** 1d2 **vampires** and 1d4+1 **vampire spawn.**

**Werewolf Raiders:** 1d4+1 **werewolves,** 1d4+4 **wolves,** and 1 werewolf leader (level 1d6+1). To determine the leader’s class, roll d%: 01–15, cleric; 16–25, druid; 26–60, fighter;61–75, ranger; 76–90, rogue; 91–100, sorcerer.

## NPCs parties for random encounters



# Random Weather

Many different weather influences impact the Silver Marches.

The prevailing weather patterns in this part of Faerûn tend to come from the Sea of Swords to the west, and the presence of high mountains on all sides often creates “cloud barriers” that force frequent precipitation. The presence of Anauroch nearby also influences the weather in unpredictable ways. Any particular day’s weather consists of three components: the temperature, the wind strength, and the precipitation.

Tables 8 through 11 provide random weather combina￾tions based on each season, weighted toward more or less likely results. A sudden thaw in the mountains is possible in winter, but it’s not as likely as long stretches of bitter cold or heavy snow.

## USING THE TABLES

Any given weather condition lasts for 1d6 days before a new pattern sets in, so it’s only necessary to roll for new weather when the previous pattern ends, not every day. The weather tables are organized into three basic locations: river valleys, open country, and northern or alpine areas. Apply the same die roll to all three regions (this makes it less likely that the mountains will be experiencing a rare thaw at the same time the river valleys are suffering from a brutal cold snap).

**River Valley:** The Rauvin and Sundabar vales fall into this category, as well as the eaves of the High Forest. Although plagued by heavy fogs throughout the year, these regions are more sheltered than other parts of the Silver Marches.

**Open Country:** The Evermoors, Moonlands, Old Delzoun (except for Sundabar Vale), and the forests of the northern Silver Marches fall into this category.

**Northern or Alpine Regions:** The Ice, Nether, and Rauvin mountains fall into this category, as well as other lands that are hard against the Spine of the World, such as the Druar￾wood and the Lands Against the Wall.

## DEFINITIONS

Results from Tables 8 through 11 are described below.

**Temp.:** Temperature results fall into the following broad categories. Nighttime temperatures are generally 10 to 20 degrees colder and may actually fall into the next colder cat￾egory (50% chance).

Hot: Between 30° and 44° F.

Warm: Temperatures between 16° and 30° F.

Moderate: Temperatures from 5° to 16° F.

Cold: Temperatures between -18° and 5° F.

Extreme Cold: Temperatures below -18° F.

Wind: The strength of the prevailing wind. Periods of calm or sudden stronger gusts are possible. Wind strength de￾creases one category at night (severe to strong, for example).

The three results on the Random Weather tables are fair, varies, and storm. Consult Table 12.

**TABLE 12: WIND STRENGTH**

| Fair   | Varies | Storm  | Strength       |
|--------|--------|--------|----------------|
| 01–70  | 01–40  | —      | Light/moderate |
| 71–95  | 41–70  | 01–10  | Strong         |
| 96–100 | 71–90  | 11–50  | Severe         |
| —      | 91–100 | 51–89  | Windstorm      |
| —      | —      | 90–100 | Hurricane      |

Wind effects are summarized on Table 3–17 in the DUNGEON MASTER’s Guide.

Precip.: The type of precipitation that falls during the day. A solid day of rain is pretty rare—even during heavy blizzards, clear spells hours long may appear.

**Clear:** No precipitation of note.

**Downpour:** 1d3 downpours lasting 1d4 hours each occur during the day. Otherwise, the day consists of rain.

**Fog:** There is a 75% chance that the fog burns off during the af￾ternoon, resulting in 1d4+2 hours of clear weather before sunset.

**Hail:** 1d3 hailstorms lasting 1d6×10 minutes each occur during the day. Otherwise the day consists of rain.

**Heavy Snow:** Heavy snow falls throughout the day, although 1d3–1 clear spells lasting 1d4 hours each break up the day.

**Rain:** Rain falls consistently throughout the day, although 1d4–1 clear spells lasting 1d4 hours each break up the day.

**Sandstorm:** Sandstorm conditions persist throughout the day, punctuated by 1d4–2 breaks lasting 1d4 hours each.

**Snow:** Snow falls steadily, but 1d4–1 clear breaks of 1d4 hours each interrupt the snowfall.

**Sleet:** Sleet falls for most of the day, broken by 1d4–2 breaks lasting 1d4 hours each.

**Thunderstorm:** 1d3 thunderstorms lasting 2d6×10 min￾utes each occur during the day. Otherwise the day is clear (50% chance) or rainy (50% chance).
